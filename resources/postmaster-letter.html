        <p>Dear Postmaster,</p>
        <p>Many individuals and organizations throughout the USA donate reading matter to Bible Foundation and mail it
        to us using the LIBRARY RATE as authorized in the Domestic Mail Manual Section 173, Part 5.0. Occasionally, a
        post office is unfamiliar with the regulation and refuses to allow our donors (who receive no benefit from the
        donation) to mail under it. USPS webpage <a href="http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/173.htm" target=
        "_blank">http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/173.htm</a> has the regulation. You can see an excerpt from it
        below.</p>
        <p>Bible Foundation is a qualified nonprofit religious organization and is dependent on many donors to help
        many people throughout the world. Please honor this postal regulation and allow our donors to continue to
        help.</p>
        <p>Thank you.</p><br>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Bible Foundation</p><br>
