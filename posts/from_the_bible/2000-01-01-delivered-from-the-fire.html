        <h1>Delivered from the Fire</h1>
        <p><em><a href="from-the-bible.html">From the Bible</a></em></p>
        <p>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
        answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
        furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we
        will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
        <p>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and
        Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was
        wont to be heated. And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and
        Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. Then these men were bound in their coats, their
        hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
        Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew
        those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
        fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and
        rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of
        the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king. He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose,
        walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
        Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach,
        Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach,
        and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire. And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's
        counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair
        of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</p>
        <p>Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent
        his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their
        bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. Therefore I make a decree, That
        every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
        Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that
        can deliver after this sort. Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of
        Babylon.</p>
