        <h1>Blessings</h1>
        <p><em>30 April 1998</em></p>
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>The Lord continues to bless the Bible ministry. Month after month, Bibles and portions flow out. The web
        site receives thousands of hits and "tons" of information and files flow. Dozens of emails come in from around
        the world. One doctor in Great Britain sent a contribution with the statement: "Let me say again that I really
        do share in your desire to make God known to others. May God be with you." The encouragement is greatly
        appreciated. One lady in South Dakota wrote that she had another 50 Bibles ready to mail overseas.</p>
        <p>What a blessing. One lady provided the funds to purchase a batch of Picture Bibles (comic book style) from
        International Bible Society and then placed them in doctors offices. One contact in Malawi said they take the
        Scripture to "homes, hospitals, prisons, schools, markets, small churches, bus stations, railways stations, and
        an open air meetings just to mention few." Bible Foundation relies heavily on donated storage and freight
        services. Please pray with us about transportation needs in Texas.</p>
        <h1>From the mail bag:</h1>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Please, the reason why I am writing to you is that I am seamstress and I have opened my shop on 14th
          November 1997. All of my machines has been stolen and I decided to kill myself because of stolen of my
          equipment. But I read one of your pamphlet and immediately I finished reading, I took God as my personal
          saviour. That is why I am still living."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>ZIMBABWE</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Devaluation of Zimbabwen currency is making a price of Bibles almost beond the reach of people."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>MALAWI</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"What a wonderful blessing it is to see many friends turned from darkness to light, accepting Jesus as
          their only saviour and lord. The scriptural leaflets, books, and Bibles are weapons and they are putting out
          the burning arrows shot by the devil."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>ROMANIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I am learning English. The Bible would be a good way. Because, here in Romania, it is not possible to buy
          a good one, I am asking you for one."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"One time I attacked someone and collected his gold and later destroyed him. I was arrested... now I am in
          jail for 36 years. But through the help of your tracts which has reached me by my blockmaster, now I know
          that there is a God which I have to serve and now my life is changed."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>MALAWI</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Thank you very much for the work of love sending Bibles, New Testaments and gospel tracts for free
          distribution to the needy. Indeed, you have helped us through the whole year 1997. We have been seen in many
          areas of life like in lunch hour meetings, open air meetings in villages, in schools, in colleges, in
          secondary schools. Our reports shows that 1,107 people have accepted Jesus Christ as the result of your
          literature. Would you also be with us this 1998?"</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>UGANDA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Thank you... Your ministry (Bible Foundation) is doing an excellent work. Keep on! There is great demand
          for Bibles here."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>ZAMBIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"We send our love to you and to thank you most sincerely for the good work you are doing to mobilise God's
          own creation and plunder hell."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>TRINIDAD & TOBAGO</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Thank you so much. Thoughtful, kind and caring are just a few words to describe you. People like you make
          life a wonderful treasure. Thank you so much for all that you've done, it really meant a lot. Words will
          never be able to express the depth of appreciation this brings today. ... There is a great need for Bibles.
          The shipment you sent to us went like hot bread from a bakery."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"With gratitude to the Lord, our Saviour, I express my sincere thanks and appreciation for the way you
          have been regularly sending the Bibles to us for the past months. These Bibles have been very well received.
          It is wonderful the impact it has created in the lives of our new converts and we are tremendously blessed.
          Because recently a Christian village that we established among the mix Islamic religious set was destroy by
          rampaging Muslims, and those that were able to flee has come out without even a leaflet of the Holy word of
          God. Sooner than this problems do your Bibles arrived though it could not meet the number of the people it
          has serve a purpose. God richly bless you."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>TOGO</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I have already share Bibles and some to unbelievers. Thank God that they are reading their Bible and
          believe to the word of God, and now they are participating to the work of God."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>MALAWI</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Would you kindly send me as many Bibles as you can. Not for the college but to the Christians who lost
          their properties with the flooding water which washed away their houses, herds, clothes, Bibles, hymns,
          etc."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I'm still distributing the tracts and the demand for it is still growing. The avenues cannot remain
          closed in Jesus mighty name. By God's grace our church is increasing in souls and the members are increasing
          in the knowledge of God. The backslidden and the lost are finding their way back to Jesus. I would therefore
          plead with you not to stop sending the Bibles and tracts as you are doing. It is really blessing people and
          advancing God's kingdom."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>ETHIOPIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"You see so many people need the English Bible and they are asking me. Even those who are not Christian
          will ask for the Bible, but I give priority for those born-again Christians."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>MALAWI</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"This letter is to thank you for your Bibles and tracts, which you sent for us. We know your Bibles and
          tracts will help us as we evangelize and God will cause our united efforts to bring forth fruit. I am deeply
          grateful for all you have done to help in my spiritual growth, so I am able to serve our God and help others.
          My prayer is that the Lord will continue bless you so we can continue receiving the literature to help us win
          souls to our Lord."</p>
