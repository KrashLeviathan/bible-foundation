        <h1>M-bag Parties, Successes, Gladiolas</h1>
        <p><em>22 January 1998</em></p>
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>M-bag parties are a success. We had three in 1997 and the next is scheduled for the 28th of February, 9am at
        North Valley Friends Church on College Ave. at North Valley Road. We put out over 100 mail bags of Bibles to
        about 30 countries and more people keep getting involved.</p>
        <p>How do you put a value on it? Thousands of people, organizations, radio stations, publishers, etc. around
        the United States are getting involved and doing what they can. Many thousands of Bibles and millions of Bible
        portions go around the world. People receive them and the distribution process continues. There is great joy
        knowing one's efforts and contributions are multiplied many times. A little money goes a very long way.</p>
        <p>The internet continues to generate interesting opportunities. Our web site <a href=
        "http://www.bf.org">http://www.bf.org</a> receives thousands of "hits" a month. This brings some interesting
        email. A man in Norway requested information so he could mail English Bibles from Norway. A man in Mozambique
        emailed and requested Bibles be sent to him via Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>A great wintertime blessing was bestowed on many of the local volunteers. A shipper that has donated many
        tons of free freight services to us over the last 10 years had 2 crates of fresh gladiolas in Portland to
        dispose of and he let us have them. The flowers were shared amongst many of the volunteers and brought a
        beautiful and colorful wintertime blessing that was greatly enjoyed.</p>
        <h1>From the mail bag:</h1>
        <h2>JAMAICA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I also hear of the wonderful and great work that you are doing from a relative of mine. ... Those tract
          that you have sent to her, they have helped me a lot and I love to read them. ... I'm telling you she's been
          doing a great job, she's been passing out tracts and also the Bibles to those who don't have any."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>INDIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Just recently a young Hindu who was a drug addict and discouraged with life, was on a railway bridge,
          about to jump over to train. His name is Mr. S. He reached into his bag for drugs to make it easier. In his
          bag was a Bible and tract given to him earlier by us. After reading the John 3:18, he visited us with
          questions. He talked with us about two hours and was saved. Now he is a missionary to his own people in
          Madras, South India. This was all through a Bible Foundation Bible."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>NIGERIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Through my drug connections, I easily learned the business of drug distribution and eventually became a
          successful drug dealer in order to keep up my own habit. I was further enticed into the drug scene as I
          partied with popular rock musicians and was captivated by their hedonistic existence. I was involved in
          smuggling large quantities of cocaine from west to south Africa after sometime. I became a heavy cocaine
          user, but now I'm change clean. Washed by the blood of Jesus. I thank God for men like you who changed my
          life. I also thank God that my lives are richer and fuller, more stable than ever before and peaceful through
          knowing Jesus as my personal saviour."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>MALAWI</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Bibles are very expensive so that many churches are using tracts instead of using Bibles."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Please pray that the Lord will provide for much more Scripture to go out and then do what you can.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Jerry Kingery</p>
