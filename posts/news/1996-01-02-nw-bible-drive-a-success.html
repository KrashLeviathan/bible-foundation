        <h1>NW Bible Drive a Sucess</h1>
        <p><em>2 January 1996</em></p>
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>You are invited to an <strong>open house</strong> and work party Monday, January 15 between 7 and 8 p.m.
        Come and go as you please. Look at the photos and materials that show the ministry; visit and ask questions,
        and help package some Bibles for mailing, if you feel like it.</p>
        <p><strong>Churches are asked</strong> to send representatives and announce in their services and groups that
        there are volunteer opportunities to help send thousands of Bibles overseas. The Scripture ministry has many
        aspects, including courier opportunities for international travelers and military personnel. Folks that would
        like to get involved are encouraged to explore the possibilities.</p>
        <p><strong>The NW Bible drive</strong> was a wonderful success with almost 6,000 Bibles, Testaments, etc.
        coming in during October and November, with over 7,000 for the whole year. Just before the end of the year,
        $2,500.00 was donated for the purchase of another 2,000+ one dollar Bibles and another $1,000.00 was donated
        which can be used for postage. Rejoice with us in all that the Lord is doing.</p>
        <h1>From the mail bag:</h1>
        <h2>Missouri</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A Sunday school class of 7 children collected 100 Bibles and mailed them and the teacher wrote: "Thank you
          so much for the opportunity to provide God's Word to other countries."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>INDIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I am overwhelmed by your response in sending me the Bible."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>NIGERIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"May God bless you for your effort in sending gospel materials to Nigeria in Jesus' name."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>CAMEROON</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I am a young preacher of age 26 years. For long time, I was searching where my vision can be
          revolutionalised. Thank God who have lead me into your ministry."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>UGANDA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Thanks for the Bible Foundation Ministry that the Lord has entrusted into your leadership. Thanks for the
          vision you have at least to give used Bibles to those believers who have no Bibles. Keep on! We are
          supporting you by our daily prayers. ...Therefore as I have already mentioned in my first letter, we are
          displaced and most of us are refugees here in Uganda. We have lost almost all the necessary materials for our
          personal use and the Lord's work, due to the civil war in the Sudan. There is GREAT NEED of Bibles among the
          displaced people in the camps. Kindly we beg more used Bibles. People very much like the Word of God
          (Bibles)."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Thank you for the five (5) Holy Bibles that arrived at our end. ...Ordained murder (executioner) is
          listening to Gospel daily and also demanded for Bible. The paramount chief also called on us for Bible.
          School children are eager to possess New Testaments for their daily study. Really there is a great need. Help
          us to populate heaven."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Fourth week ago I have fast for 3 days and I ask God to give me a Holy Bible, so the moment I came across
          your address I thanked God so much."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
