        <h1>Bible Drive, Cooperation</h1>
        <p><em>31 October 1997</em></p>
        <h2>October Bible Drive:</h2>
        <p>The sixth annual drive received great publicity and much far reaching community support and large loads of
        Bibles continue to come in. The publicity included several newspaper articles and radio interviews. A nice
        surprise was the additional publicity received by K-LOVE radio in California and Arizona.</p>
        <h2>It takes a lot of cooperation to move the loads:</h2>
        <p>In April a Newberg business man arranged for 2 pallets of Bible portions to be shipped from Ohio to Newberg.
        Over the months, after the balance was ready, the trucking ministry in Indianapolis picked up the other 9
        pallets in Ohio and took them to Atlanta to a firm that took them to Florida. The Florida company brought 3 of
        them to Portland and took the other 6 to a freight company in northern California who had already received 3
        pallets of used Bibles from a Washington based trucking firm that had picked them up in Newberg. The northern
        California company took the 9 pallets to our contact in Hollywood, California that will distribute them except
        for 2 pallets of Spanish Bible portions that were picked up there by relatives of an evangelist in El Salvador
        to start them on their journey to Central America. This was many tons of donated freight, saving thousands of
        dollars.</p>
        <h2>M-bag party in Newberg:</h2>
        <p>Ten volunteers prepared 101 mail bags with Bibles and portions to go to 30 countries. Appreciation goes to
        host Free Methodist Church.</p>
        <h2>Internet at work:</h2>
        <p>Folks around the country have been requesting information on collecting Bibles and also on mailing them
        overseas. Assistance was given to one query from Japan seeking a source for Spanish Bibles by referring to the
        local United Bible Society office.</p>
        <h2>From the mail bag:</h2>
        <h3>GHANA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I read 4 scriptures each night and have now get to know God better through prayers and studying this
          scriptures. What wondered me is that I don't think of anything apart from God."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>LIBYA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I am Muslim ... send me your message about Christian religion."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>GHANA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"There are hundreds of prisoners today preaching and all their powers comes from the Bible Foundation
          tracts and the Bibles sent to us. There are terrible criminals here, but today through the God of America and
          the God of Bible Foundation they have reformed."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>SRI LANKA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"These Bibles were prayerfully given out to 6 new "Born Again" poor believers who could never really
          afford to purchase a Bible, even if it were available in this Buddhist village, as Christian book shops are
          truly prohibited, and as such the gift of these Bibles really resulted in great thanksgiving to God."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>ETHIOPIA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Even if you are afar from Ethiopia you are doing an amazing service towards the Lord in participating in
          the Lord's works here in our part of the world. I do really appreciate and thank God.".</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>MALAWI</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Many have been blessed with those Bibles in areas where we distributed those Bibles free. Praise God! He
          is so wonderful to listen us beg. You have been used by God to send Word of God. ... Seventy-nine people
          committed their lives to Jesus Christ as the result of reading the literature you sent us."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>SOUTH AFRICA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I just want to extend my sincere gratitude of thanks for all the Bibles that you are sending us. These
          Bibles have reached many that are in need of Bibles. ... Be blessed to know that you are a part of the rich
          harvest that God is giving us. Once again THANK YOU VERY MUCH."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The cry for Bibles and portions is immense. Thousands around the nation and around the world partner with
        efforts and contributions to freely move God's word. The value of every dollar donated is multiplied many fold
        as a result. Praise God for what he is doing.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
