        <h1>Good Year 1996, Trucker to Assist</h1>
        <p><em>13 January 1997</em></p>
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p><strong>1996 was a great year:</strong> The Lord continues to raise up folks to help move Scripture. Over
        5700 Bibles, NT's, etc. were collected last year with over 3200 of them coming in after the October drive
        started. The mail volume escalated and over 20,000 letters came in from around the world. More and more people
        are finding out that they can get involved and assist with moving Scriptures to needy hearts.</p>
        <p><strong>Praise God!</strong> Trucker Dan has agreed to assist with moving some very needed cartons from
        southern California to Newberg. The printer in Ohio has printed the 10,000,000 portions and they are now being
        cut, cartoned, and palletized. Please pray that we will be able to work out good transportation
        arrangements.</p>
        <p><strong>Rejoice with us!</strong> The mail we receive continues to bring wonderful heart warming stories of
        how God is delivering souls and people are growing in the Lord and learning to commune with the Lord. Bibles
        have been moving into Europe and our Austrian connection established a contact in Ireland. Saint Louis, MO
        reported good success with the Bible drive with more participation.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"I write to you having had the blessed opportunity of reading just one tract published by you. I am a born
          again Christian serving the Lord in this remote Buddhist and Hindu village where the gospel of our Lord Jesus
          has not been preached before, and in charge of a few born again Christians who are actively involved with me
          in preaching, teaching, and witnessing about the Lord Jesus in hospitals, prisons and from house to house. We
          do not belong to any denomination, but serve the Lord of our own free will. The reason I write is to very
          humbly appeal to you to send us a grant of these greatly needed tracts along with any other literature you
          could spare to help us win lost souls and strengthen new believers in their faith."</p>
