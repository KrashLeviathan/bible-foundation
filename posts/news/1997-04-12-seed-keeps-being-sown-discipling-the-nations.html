        <h1>Seed Keeps Being Sown, Discipling the Nations</h1>
        <p><em>12 April 1997</em></p>
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p><strong>The seed keeps being sown:</strong> People around the country continually share the word of God. The
        couple in Ohio that have been mailing Bibles overseas have now sent out over 8,300 since 1992. A group of young
        people in Pennsylvania have developed an evangelistic outreach of witnessing and passing out tracts. They said
        the fire of evangelism is growing and more and more young people are wanting to join them. The Portland camp
        stove ministry continues to feed the street people on Friday and Saturday nights and souls continue to come to
        the Lord and Bibles go out. The lady in South Dakota recently requested another 80 mailing labels to send
        Bibles overseas. A seafarer wrote from United Arab Emirates that there were several believers on ship and he
        would like Bibles to be able to give out in their journeys. In one project, volunteers prepared 74 mail bags,
        filling a Suburban to the roof.</p>
        <p><strong>The internet ministry grows:</strong> The Bible Foundation web site <a href=
        "http://www.bf.org">http://www.bf.org</a> continues to offer more materials and services. Various public domain
        Bibles and materials are available as well as links to numerous Scripture related sites. Information about the
        Scripture ministry is also available.</p>
        <p><strong>Discipling the nations:</strong> Folks are encouraged to teach others (1) to read Scripture and ask
        God to reveal himself in it, and (2) to ask God in every situation of life for wisdom and quietly listen to
        what he puts into the heart. This teaches people how to feast on the word and grow in the Lord.</p>
        <p><strong>Please pray</strong> that the Lord of the harvest will continue to raise up folks to help.</p>

        <h3>KENYA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Many people we gave the tracts came after two or three days and wanted to receive Jesus as their personal
          saviour. Eighty people got saved in the first crusade."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>NIGERIA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I have read your tracts entitled 'God Is Our Refuge' and 'The Lord Be Magnified'. Thank you for these
          tracts which have been very helpful to me. I will be grateful if you send these tracts to me for distribution
          to the unreached citizens of this world."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>SENEGAL</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"God bless you all. Thank you again and again to you all who made it possible to send me "THE HOLY
          BIBLES". Thank you all."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>MALAYSIA</h3>
        <blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"I sent one large lettered English Bible to an old couple in a home. They are very very happy to receive

          treasure to him."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>UGANDA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"There is great demand for used Bibles here. Many believers have no Bibles in their hands, especially
          those in the rural areas. ... Therefore we beg you to continue sending us more used Bibles."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>An African prison officer</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Many people have been reformed here through your anointed tracts that you send here. Kindly do well to
          send me more of your tracts alongside BIBLES. Your tracts are indeed good for the inmates."</p>
