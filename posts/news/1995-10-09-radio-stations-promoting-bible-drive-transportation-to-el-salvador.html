        <h1>Radio Stations Promoting Bible Drive; Transportation to El Salvador</h1>
        <p><em>9 October 1995</em></p>
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>There is cause for great rejoicing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The NW Bible drive is well underway with KDBX, KPDQ, KPHP, and K-Love radio stations cosponsoring the
          promotion. The Saint Louis, Missouri Bible drive is also underway.</li>
          <li>Transportation to El Salvador has been arranged for millions of Scripture portions.</li>
          <li>A man in Missouri is helping us get 2268 new paperback Bibles.</li>
          <li>Much promotional printing has been donated.</li>
          <li>Much publicity for the Bible drive has been donated.</li>
          <li>Much transportation has been donated.</li>
          <li>The current print run of 12,000,000 small portions and 200,000 giant print portions brings the total
          since 1987 to over 158,000,000 and 1,000,000 respectively.</li>
          <li>Many Newberg area folks help with processing mail, shipping packages, typing, bookkeeping and office
          help, as well as hundreds of folks in the Northwest to assist the Bible drive.</li>
        </ul>
