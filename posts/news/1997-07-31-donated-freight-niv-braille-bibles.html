        <h1>Donated Freight, NIV Braille Bibles</h1>
        <p><em>31 July 1997</em></p>
        <h2>Donated freight:</h2>
        <p>A new contact can help with picking up loads of Bibles in upstate Ohio and pallets of one million Bible
        portions in southwest Ohio from our printer. He can deliver pallets to Chicago and hold pallets in Indianapolis
        for pickup by the Florida trucker to bring to Oregon. He can also take pallets to Georgia to a firm which can
        take them to the Florida trucker who can take them to northern California to a firm that can deliver them to
        the destination. Also an Oregon based company will take pallets from Newberg to California. It takes a little
        juggling but God has raised up an incredible network of donated Bible freight.</p>
        <p>Ten brand new NIV Braille Bibles became available in Portland, Oregon and we took them to a blind man that
        has been sending materials to blind people since 1984. He will handled the distribution and told us he
        especially wanted to get some to blind schools in Africa.</p>
        <h2>M-bag party in Newberg:</h2>
        <p>Ten volunteers prepared 90 mail bags with Bibles and portions to go to 30 countries. Appreciation goes to
        host Newberg Christian Church.</p>
        <h2>Nationally:</h2>
        <p>Ten year old Jeremy in Georgia wrote saying he likes our little tracts and would like to receive some. Lamar
        in Tennessee shared that he received the giant print Scripture portions for their nursing home ministry. They
        have about 35 services a month and read the portions to the residents and then leave them. Often they're asked
        to leave more for residents that didn't make it to the service. Lamar has had 4 heart by pass operations and is
        not able to work but enjoys distributing Scripture and has seen many ask Jesus to save them. Several years ago
        when living in Iowa, Mike heard about Bible Foundation on the radio and started to collect old Bibles and
        Christian literature. After moving to Mississippi he's started up again and is running an ad in the newspaper
        and got a list of over 5,000 churches in the State and is mailing to about 100 a month. He says: "I have never
        enjoyed working on something more in my life."</p>
        <h2>From the mail bag:</h2>
        <h3>CAMEROON</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I'm a missionary evangelist planting churches ... A sub Division of about 50,000 inhabitants without a
          single bookshop where one can buy any literature. In short it's very very difficult here to get a Bible.
          We've planted 7 churches in the space of 4 yrs by the grace of God and there's a great need of literature to
          help these churches grow. So I went to my co-labourer for help... He referred me to you because he had
          nothing in stock to give me. So brethren, kindly assist us here with literature even old Bibles of any
          quantity we shall be very grateful."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>GHANA</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I have been going out with some bad boys when you send this tracts for reading, so when I received your
          reply with this tracts. I take time to read it and when I was reading I saw that what I am doing with these
          bad boys is not good for my life. So I have to stop it to end my bad life. But at first we have been going
          out to chasing girls. But now I have stop chasing girls because of what I have seeing from the tracts, so I
          want you to send me Bible to be reading to know the ways of God! I thank you very much for taking me into
          good life."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>MALAWI</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Friend in Christ, I thank the Lord for your materials you send me last year. And they have done a lot to
          me. Many of unsaved people have come to know and repent their sins through your Bibles and Tracts. Once more
          again, would you please kindly send me some of the Holy Bibles and Tracts and some spiritual books."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>CAMEROON</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Agnes wrote they go into the interiors to witness and hold crusades. They travel to the villages on foot
          and by canoe and asked for Bibles for their work.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Please pray that the Lord will raise up more folks in Newberg to help with the increasing work loads.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Jerry Kingery</p>
