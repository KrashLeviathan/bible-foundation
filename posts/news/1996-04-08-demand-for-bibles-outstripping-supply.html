  <h1>Demand for Bibles Outstripping Supply</h1>
  <p><em>8 April 1996</em></p>
  <p>Dear Friend,</p>
  <p><strong>How do you collect and mail thousands of Bibles to needy people around the world?</strong> You don't,
  unless the Lord raises up lots of folks with the heart to help. Many people in Oregon and around the country have
  gotten involved but the demand for Bibles continues to escalate, outstripping the ability to supply. Letters begging
  for Bibles once coming in at a rate of 30 to 40 a week now come in at a rate of 300 to 400 a week with 723 last
  week.</p>
  <p><strong>Trucker Dan!</strong> A man in Newberg that donates warehouse space for the Bible ministry read in January
  about the radio station in Coos Bay, Oregon that wanted to do a Bible drive there and thought of his brother that
  worked for a Christian radio station in Redding, California. He suggested I contact him which and when I did, he told
  me about a trucker that had come into the station 4 years earlier and offered to transport materials for Christian
  groups on occasion at no cost but he said he was moving and only left his old phone number and the name of the small
  town he was moving to. Since we needed to have a pallet of Bibles brought from Hollywood, California to Newberg,
  Oregon, I tracked the man down and called his house. His wife said he worked for someone else now and was not in a
  position to do that anymore. As we talked she suggested I contacted a retired trucking broker in a small town in
  southern Oregon. I did and he referred me to several others. One of those also referred me to several others and then
  said "What town did you say you were in?" When I said "Newberg," he told me about trucker Dan. He said Dan drove
  truck to Los Angeles every week and might be able to haul the load. I contacted Dan and we made arrangements and
  within a few weeks, the load was in Newberg, at no cost to Bible Foundation. We tried for many months to find a way
  to get the Bibles to Newberg and it happened in a most fascinating roundabout way.</p>
  <p><strong>Please pray</strong> that the Lord will provide a new printing source for the Scripture portions and that
  he will raise up more help to mail thousands of Bibles to begging hearts overseas. Rejoice with us in all that the
  Lord is doing.</p>
  <h1>From the mail bag:</h1>
  <h2>Akwa, NIGERIA</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"In the evening of 3rd Nov 1995, about 8:30 p.m. some of our students were in the classroom reading, others in
    the chapel praying. Group of Muslim hierarchy with their army surrounded our premises and set fire. Before the
    students could realize this, fire was already surrounded them. It was only few students could escape from this
    incident through bountiful love of God. Twenty-five lives were lost, three hundred and sixty eight others wounded.
    We could only stand and cry out to God as we saw everything devoured by the fiery flames which leaped high into the
    air."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Uyo, NIGERIA</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"There is a great and serious evangelistic works among Muslim in that Muslim hierarchy has organized an army of
    Muslim with an order to bring all the converts back into the fold of Mohamedism. This has resulted in severe
    persecution for many of the converts. So severe that their lives were threaten and their Bibles were burnt. Some
    were badly beaten and forced to leave their village after all their personal possession were confiscated. The real
    and biggest problem we face now, brethren, is to provide these our dear converts and those whose Bibles were burnt
    and personal possessions confiscated with Bibles. In many areas, up to 100 believers share one Bible. In some
    areas, the ratio of converts to Bible is 1000 to 1. One of the converts said to me last month, 'I wish I would
    learn God's word by heart. But I do not have good memory. My greatest wish is to possess Holy Bible.' Our real and
    greatest need brethren is to provide these our dear converts and those brethren whose Bibles were burnt and
    personal possession confiscated with Bibles. This is why brethren we are now sharing this letter with you today
    with this enclosed one hundred names of our converts and brethren whose Bibles were burnt and personal possessions
    with no money to purchase another Bible."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Folks that will be in the Newberg area Monday, April 15, 1996 are invited to an open house from 7 to 8 p.m.
  Photos, materials, visiting and an optional work project will be available at Newberg Friends Church, 307 South
  College Street in Newberg, in the Barclay A room of the back building. Parking is available behind the church, off
  4th Street.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
