  <h1>Bible Drives, Networking, and Internet Connection</h1>
  <p><em>25 March 2003</em></p>
  <h2>Bible Drives spread</h2>
  <p>Many people around the country have gotten involved with the collection and distribution of used Bibles. One radio
  station in Illinois did a local drive in December, hoping to get 500 Bibles. They were astonished to receive over
  3,500. What they didn’t use locally, they hauled in a rented truck to the master collection center about 100 miles
  away. Individuals, groups, organizations, and churches collect used Bibles and purchase low cost new ones.</p>
  <h2>Networking works</h2>
  <p>The Bible master collection centers around North American make it easier for people near them to do Bible drives.
  Donors make it possible for Bible Foundation to send out thousands of Bibles and millions of Bible portions. Many
  folks are helping individually in many ways. A young man in Sweden is helping send Bibles into Iran. A lady in Canada
  is sending Bibles into Liberia. A lady in Georgia requested more Bible portions and said “I always feel so on fire
  for the Lord” when handing them out. A lady in Oregon is doing online research to find chaplains that can use the
  Bible reading packets.</p>
  <h2>The Internet connection</h2>
  <p>Since 1996, we have provided at no cost many e-texts including some public domain Bible texts to Bible software
  programmers. Millions of people have access to materials that came through the web site. Our web site www.bf.org
  still generates much interest and also many requests for Bibles. We registered two other domains.
  www.biblefoundation.org and www.bibledrive.org which point to our web site. Requests come in from many countries,
  besides the USA. In recent months we have even been receiving requests from China and Iran. Recently, we received our
  first request from Algeria.</p>
  <h2>Small packages from Newberg, OR</h2>
  <p>Many people provide the Bibles, money, and labor to respond to thousands of requests a year with small packages of
  used English Bibles and Bible portions. Much is being done but please pray the Lord will provide for much more to be
  done.</p>
  <h1>From the mail bag</h1>
  <h2>ALGERIA</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“I have the great honor to contact you for the first time .At first i'm an algerian student .i want to know more
    information about Christianity .please send a copy of the Holy Bible in English”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>SRI LANKA</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“I write to thank you with all of my heart for the gift box you sent, containing the used Bibles and the tracts,
    which I received very safely. Every Bible and soul saving tract is prayerfully given out free of charge and many
    lost souls have come to Christ and are gladly reading the word of God, and are growing in their faith. Yes we thank
    God for your wonderful ministry, which our Lord is using to do great things over here. We again very humbly appeal
    to you to please continue sending us used Bibles and tracts. Our small house church believers and I will faithfully
    continue to pray for you and the Bible Foundation ministry.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>GHANA</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Thank you for sending me the parcel and because they were put to good use. Our church has more than doubled. On
    account of this I am taking this opportunity as the coming of Jesus Christ is eminent and more people are being won
    for Christ, I would be glad if another parcel of used or old bibles are mailed to us for distribution to help in
    the great commission that Jesus has called us into. New believers are grouped so they can all study the bible. It
    has worked even though we have to circulate the bibles in each group so that each could have access to read them
    individually weekly in turns. At least some people have been won to Christ and presently are on fire for Christ
    since we received the parcel some two years ago."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>INDIA</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"I have been distributing the Bibles free in Schools, Hospitals and Market yards, Prison - cells and remote
    villages prayerfully. Thank you so much for your living kind and great health towards this least fellow man. I
    cannot express my gratitude through these words."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h1>The cry for Bibles and portions is immense.</h1>
  <p>Thousands of people around the nation and around the world harmonize efforts and contributions to freely move
  God’s word. The value of every dollar donated is multiplied many fold as a result. Praise God for what he is
  doing.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
