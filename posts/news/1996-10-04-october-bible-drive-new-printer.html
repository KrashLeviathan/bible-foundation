        <h1>October Bible Drive, New Printer</h1>
        <p><em>4 October 1996</em></p>
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p><strong>The October Bible drive is under way:</strong> Our fifth annual drive here in the northwest is now
        in progress. Many churches and individuals have called to express their support. Many help with the October
        publicity but remember the collection centers accept Bibles year round.</p>
        <p><strong>Praise God!</strong> We now have a new printer for the Scripture portions after all these months.
        They are a ministry with a fairly new press with 3 webs and they are now printing 10,000,000 portions for
        us.</p>
        <p><strong>Rejoice with us!</strong> We are getting wonderful letters telling how God is using his word to
        change lives. We have sent many Bibles and much Scripture to the prison where P.T. is and we've received a
        letter from a man that was saved when in prison there and is now free and living for the Lord as an evangelist.
        New areas keep opening up. A long time supporter introduced to us a missionary to Europe that will help get
        Scriptures into a number of areas including Austria, Bosinia, Macedonia Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p><strong>Over 100 countries</strong> use the English language and cries for Bibles pour in. A seamen's center
        in Senegal, a young minister in Cameroon, an evangelist in Zimbabwe, 'juju' priest converts in Nigeria, plus
        thousands more need English Bibles. Remember, the more help, the more Scripture goes out. Please pray the Lord
        of the harvest will raise up more folks to help.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"I am the boy which you reply this week. I have pray to Lord and I think He has forgive me my sins...I
          have read all the scriptures that you send me and now I believe Jesus is my Saviour...now you have help me to
          known more about Jesus."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"You ask me to read 48 scripture selections at least 100 times and ask the Lord as I read them...God will
          reveal more about Himself...the Lord has done that in my life. He has change my attitude towards elder
          people, the way I talk with faulty word He has change within me. I thank Him a lot for what He has done in my
          life...now I can talk to my friends about the word of God and stop my friends from doing...things which the
          Lord does not like. Thank you very much for your dedication."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I thank you for 48 scripture you gave me. You want me to know the words of God. I cannot tell all, but
          God gave me freedom to do everything and everyday I pray to God that God give me wisdom. I thank you again
          for 48 scripture you gave me to read, that thing help me to know the words of God."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"To begin...my story: In fact we were very very bad boys in our area to the extent that we were readers of
          everybody's material, but thank God that we are all saved now. Our normal activities is to go to dance, watch
          bad films and even steal when possible. But as I said, we really thank God we've seen the light. But one
          thing which help in our connection is your ministry. As a matter of fact, it happen that my friend wrote to
          you and the result was Bible and to tell you the truth, the Bible really transformed our lives and today we
          can boldly say we are saved now. So, I wrote to you to congratulate you and your ministry for the good work
          you've done. But the sad news is, I have no Bible of my own. So please send me one."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Please, Sir, I have done what you told me and, Sir, I am seeing change in my life and I know God will
          bless you very very much for what you have done to change my life."</p>
