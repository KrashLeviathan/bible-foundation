  <h1>Bible Man, Bread Man, Rodeo</h1>
  <p>30 October 1998</p>
  <p>Dear Friend,</p>
  <p>Radio stations and publications ran publicity about the nationwide and northwest Bible drives. Also the website
  and email autoresponder continues to give out much information through <a href=
  "http://www.bf.org/bibledrive">http://www.bf.org/bibledrive</a> and <a href=
  "mailto:bibledrive@bf.org">bibledrive@bf.org</a>. This year through the end of October, Bible Foundation received
  about 8,000 Bibles, Testaments, etc.</p>
  <p>Of the many calls, letters and email queries we’ve received this quarter, it was a pleasure to assist with
  requests from Israel, Scotland and South Africa.</p>
  <h2>Rodeo</h2>
  <p>Cowboys and children in Oklahoma receive God’s love. Folks there have a saddle shop with boot repair, leatherwork,
  blacksmith, and a library. They are also involved with a rodeo company and have Bibles and Christian literature
  available at no charge in the shop and at the rodeo.</p>
  <h2>Bible Man</h2>
  <p>The Bible mystery man started dropping off hundreds of Bibles at a time at one of the collection centers. The
  frequency of every two to three weeks made it more mysterious. One day in conversation he told the storeowner that
  because the Bible ministry was there, getting used Bibles to needy people around the world, he took it on as a
  personal ministry to collect as many Bibles as possible, scrounging them wherever he could, even climbing into
  dumpsters when needed.</p>
  <h2>Bread Man</h2>
  <p>The bread man showed up September 15, part of the crew delivering several tons of the Bread of Life. The Bibles
  and portions were brought to Newberg from the Midwest by a ministry God raised up to help with the free and low cost
  transportation of Bibles.</p>
  <h1>From the mail bag:</h1>
  <h2>NIGERIA:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The Muslims hierarchy set fire on our Bible College and many others. Our staff quarters and administration
    buildings were completely burnt down instantly. We could only stand and cry out to God as we saw everythings
    devoured by the fiery flames which leaped high into the air. The week of violence left 6 dead students, 198 injured
    and a group of burned properties. …In regard to our request, we are appealing to you and your congregations to
    kindly support and help us with several copies of Thompson Chain reference Bibles, Holy Bibles…"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>TOGO:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"I read one of your tracts entitled "The King of Heaven" and I decide to write you. I am a lay preacher of the
    gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and tracts of this kinds and others are very good for evangelism. Please, I want
    you to send me tracts as plenty as you can to enable me and my team to continue with the gospel. I want you also to
    send me some Bibles for me and my friends."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>NIGERIA:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"This is to inform you that I came across some of your tracts, going through them, with the Lord of God, I
    become overwhelm. Further, I will be much delighted of other Holy books like Bible could be sent to me."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>GHANA:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"When you told me to read the 48 scriptures carefully at about 30 times. At that time I was lazy, greedy, and
    was not good in mind too. When read it I knew that greedy and laziness is not good. I change my life and now I obey
    and respect anyone who is older than me. I pray to ask God to give wisdom as you said. And God listen to my prayers
    and gave me wisdom. Even last term, my position was 20th but this term my position was 1st. I thank God very much.
    My good friend thank you for advising me with the 48 scriptures."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>SCOTLAND:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"I am delighted at being able to find and access your website. - thanks very much for the service you provide I
    am in need of some help and will give you some details about myself. We have also commenced a ministry "Gospel
    Outreach" where we offer FREE Bibles, cassettes, Booklets and correspondence courses to those who are
    interested."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>NIGERIA:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Christ deliver me from the kingdom of darkness and transform me to the kingdom of light. I and my family were
    Muslims and I was born in the northern region of Nigeria. I collaborated with some Muslim leaders to commit all
    source of atrocity, including the killing of ministers of God. … However, I was not only called by God for
    repentance, but to minister His word to the lost, especially the Muslims in Africa, because if we don't reach out
    to them in love and share the gospel with them, they will be increasingly radicalized by their fanatical mullahs
    and Imams into committing heinous acts against Africa and the rest of the world."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>GHANA:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The reason why I am informing you this friendly letter is that since I stated reading the scripture that you
    gave to me I see that God has using his miracle in me. I have read it 30 time and give some to my friends to read.
    They all are happy that God has using his miracle in them. I have got wisdom since you gave me the scripture."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>AUSTRALIA:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"We received the most great living word, profound and precious Holy Bible, and thank the Lord Jesus Christ that
    he answers our prayers that on the other side of the vast oceans and all around the globe dwells the children of
    the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ. We received all the Holy Bibles and tracts …Thanks of God Almighty our Saviour,
    Lord Jesus Christ, your priceless gift reached my family circle in the best of health. This precious, most
    powerful, living word, the Holy Bible will enlighten our path to righteousness in serving our Lord and Saviour
    Jesus Christ."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>SOUTH INDIA:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"We will be ever grateful to you for regularly sending us your tracts and Bibles, which we have prayerfully
    distributed to the needy ones. In future we require more tracts and Bibles in bulk for which I request your
    goodself to kindly pray and supply as and when Lord leads you. Also kindly send the Chain Reference Bibles,
    concordance, etc., even if it is old. Similar items our pastors in our area who are living by faith could not
    afford to make. To them indeed these items are very much useful for them to study and share God's word effectively.
    We thank and praise God for your loving heart. Since we are reaching out many unreached areas and various
    neighboring villages, we request you to kindly pray for the same. The new villages we are contacting are very
    responsive."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>GHANA:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"I heard your information from a friend...one of our groups leader. He gave me an envelope with some passages as
    a gift, which Bible Readings Packet is written on the back. I shared them to my group members one by one. Each got
    two pages. If someone finish I collect it and ask question about it and give different one to the person. I want
    twenty (20) booklet of the passages which start from BY INSPIRATION OF GOD, to THE FAITHFUL GOD contains 48 pages
    and I want only one (1) Bible."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
