        <h1>Warehouse Space Found</h1>
        <p><em>1 July 1995</em></p>
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>The Lord continues to bless the flow of Scripture as hundreds of letters and calls pour in each month. The
        Lord continues to provide and volunteer opportunities abound.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Minnesota:</strong> A call came in from the ship Caribbean Mercy which is one of the YWAM Mercy
          Ships and in port in Duluth. A 100,000 Spanish and 40,000 English portions were requested for an upcoming
          trip to the Caribbean.</li>
          <li><strong>Chicago:</strong> A man called looking for Bibles for his ministry. We had helped him a couple of
          times in 1994 and can now assist from Newberg plus our contacts in Iowa and Missouri.</li>
          <li><strong>California:</strong> A prisoner said some of his Christian brothers had written about 6 months
          ago and received some study Bibles and he would like to get one if he could. He said he is hungry for more in
          depth study in the word of God and thanked us for our ministry that reaches out to the prisoner to help those
          "who want to grow in grace and knowledge in our Lord Jesus Christ."</li>
          <li><strong>Ethiopia:</strong> One writer said he was so thirsty for the word of God but could not get a
          Bible. Another said the 14 members of their Bible study group only had one Bible and would like more with
          different versions.</li>
          <li><strong>India:</strong> A young person received a Bible Foundation Scripture portion and wrote that he
          recently read a wonderful piece from the Holy Bible from Matthew 14 titled "Jesus went unto them." He said he
          was really impressed and was very curious to know more about it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Rejoice:</h2>
        <p>Needed temporary warehouse space with access to a forklift has been made available!</p>
        <h2>Looking for:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Folks to help move and put cartons of Bibles on skids and wrap the loads.</li>
          <li>A Seattle contact that could collect and store Bibles for pick up.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Quarterly get-together:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Updates.</li>
          <li>New photos and letters from overseas.</li>

          to nursing homes.</li>
          <li>Optional simple work project.</li>
          <li>Visiting.</li>
