        <h1>USA Nationwide Bible Drive</h1>
        <p><em>27 July 1998</em></p>
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>Mail and email continue to come in and Bibles and Bible portions continue to go out. June saw another mail
        bag party in Newberg with 100 bags of Bibles going out. The internet traffic continues to increase. More people
        around the United States are getting involved.</p>
        <p>A strange coincident occurred recently when a lady sent an email seeking a Braille Bible for a special need.
        It so happened that a brand new Braille New Testament was donated and it satisfied the need.</p>
        <p>The big story is the launch of the USA Nationwide Bible Drive. July 27, 1998 saw the program materials go up
        on the internet and the mail server. Materials are available at [http://www.bf.org/bibledrive]
        (http://www.bf.org/bibledrive) and the email version is available by sending a blank email to <a href=
        "mailto:bibledrive@bf.org">bibledrive@bf.org</a>. Publicity materials have been mailed to over 200 Chirstian
        publications.</p>
        <h1>From the mail bag:</h1>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>

          be transformed by the power of God. There have been so many positive changes in my life and I bet you I have
          rich testimonies to give now. In the light of this, I have joined an evangelical association, helping to turn
          all sinners away from sin. We are fully on the work so please do send me one complete Bible to help me in my
          evangelising work."</p>

        <h2>NIGERIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"We are a Prison Ministries, serving the need of 10,000 refugees living in camps and inmates of over 561
          prisons around this West African region. We cannot keep out of prison. It is where the Lord want us to be. He
          never abandoned one lost sheep. … They wants Bibles in every bit as desperately as a concentration camp
          victim wants nourishing food. There is no people in the world that is as hungry and desperate to have a Bible
          of their own as these brethren. They will cherish even a single page torn from a Community Bible. The Bible
          will serve as a Key to open the treasure store of good things. It is a book to be read and re-read, to be
          pondered frequently, applied constantly and share with others!. Beloved Gospel Partner, you can have a part
          in leading men and women to the Lord. Especially at this hour, you can join hands with us and faithful Prison
          Chaplains. The hours are especially difficult for men and women behind bars. Hearts are especially tender as
          they think of loved ones whom they have disappointed or fail. Will you help us reach behind the bars with the
          love of Jesus now?"</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>IVORY COAST</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Your idea of aiding the lost sheep to come in, is actually excellent, and hope that the Almighty God will
          reward you and the staff richly for good work doing. Please, I need your great help to uplift the school in
          our area and hope you will assist the school by sending more BIBLES."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>IVORY COAST</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I am a new convert and I would like to know the redemptive Word of God better. It is in that light that
          I, under the advice of a friend, write to you in order that you might help me in the good times and bad to
          study the Word of God, which has already begun. For that I would like a Bible."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>NIGERIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Since the number of people demanding for Holy Bible are so many, we find it difficult to give out to be
          used personally. We only place it on our reading Chapel for everybody to go in and read, because we don't
          have enough Bible."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>GHANA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I've been receiving the Bibles you are sending to me, but most wonderful part of it is the Bible is
          reaching the parishers and souls are won into the Kingdom of God."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>NIGERIA</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I do not know how to thank or how the whole congregation could thank God for all the Bible's you send to
          us. I think that God had chosen you to experience the work that you people are doing. Your offering to us
          cannot be coming from the corrupted flesh but they are the work of the Holy Spirit that is taking place in
          you for our joy."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>MALAWI</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I am deeply grateful for all you have done to help in my spiritual growth, so I am able to serve our God
          and help others. I thank God for your literature to help us grow spiritually and that we can help win lost
          souls. May God bless you and the ministry He has given you. My prayer is that the Lord will continue blessing
          you so we can continue receiving the Bibles to help us win souls to our Lord."</p>
