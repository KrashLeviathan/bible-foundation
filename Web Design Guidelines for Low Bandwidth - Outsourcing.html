            <p>If you are concerned about making your website accessible over
                low bandwidth connections and you don't have your own in-house web
                development team then you will be considering outsourcing to a web
                design company. Even if you ask your web designers to make your
                site globally accessible, will they know what that implies? How can
                you be sure they have created a design that will work over low
                bandwidth?</p>
            <p>The purpose of this outsourcing guide is to help you write a
                tender document with clear <b>acceptance criteria</b> for a low
                bandwidth design. We will also show you how to verify that your
                website adheres to your criteria.</p>
            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-IterativeAndIncrementalDesign'>
                Iterative and Incremental Design</h3>
            <p>If you are outsourcing your website development, you may find it
                hard to know at the outset exactly what you want. Even if you start
                out thinking you do know, you will probably find that your views
                change as the project progresses. So, rather than aiming for a
                watertight technical specification at the outset, we would
                recommend that you manage the work as an incremental process.
                Specify in broad outline what you require and then refine your
                ideas as the development progresses, reviewing what is produced in
                an iterative cycle. This method of working — following an
                <b>"Agile"</b> methodology — is particularly well suited to website
                development and should make for a more flexible and efficient way
                of arriving at a result you are happy with. The interested reader
                is referred to the <a class="external" href=
                    "http://www.agilealliance.org/">Agile Alliance</a> <a class=

                                                                          href="Outsourcing.html#ref-Outsourcing-1">[1]</a>
                for
                more discussion of this.</p>
            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-UserTesting'>User Testing</h3>
            <p>User testing is often seen as a costly, time-consuming process
                and so is often avoided. This is a mistake. Every site is unique
                and <b>user testing is the only way to really find out if your
                    design works</b>. Testing with randomised selections of users,
                heavy-duty questionnaires and professionally run tests in a testing
                laboratory <i>is</i> costly, but you can get most of the benefit
                from a much simpler test. All you need is one or two users trying
                to carry out typical tasks with an observer sitting next to them
                taking notes. It is far better to test frequently throughout the
                project, when problems can be fixed, rather than once at the
                end.</p>
            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-SimulatorsAndAnalysers'>Simulators and
                Analysers</h3>
            <p>Viewing your website through a simulator makes it possible for
                you to experience it as your users will who are viewing it over low
                bandwidth. This can be a very sobering experience and is an
                important part of the testing process. Analysers are also important
                tools, allowing you to see if a site conforms to recommended limits
                on such things as page size. For details and useful links see
                <b><a class="wikipage" href="Tools.html">Tools</a></b>.</p>
            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-TheUseOfAcceptanceCriteria'>The Use of
                Acceptance Criteria</h3>
            <p>One of the difficulties in outsourcing technical work is
                specifying what needs to be done. Really the most important thing
                to specify is the <b><i>"What"</i></b> — if the developers are
                competent the technical <b><i>"How"</i></b> is probably best left
                to them. Specifying <b>acceptance criteria</b> is a good way of
                saying <b><i>"what"</i></b> needs to be done, in other words
                <i>what you will <b>accept</b></i>. The acceptance criteria that
                follow are designed to give a set of <b>quantifiable</b>
                requirements that can be put into a contract and can be used to
                measure the final product. After the criteria themselves we discuss
                why each requirement is important and how you can <b>verify</b>
                that it has been met.</p>

                    The Final Website Should Meet the Following Acceptance
                    Criteria:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>No non-incrementally loading page should exceed 25kB in size,
                        including images, external JavaScript files and external CSS
                        files.
                    </li>
                    <li>No incrementally loading page should exceed 75kB, including
                        images, external JavaScript files and external CSS files.
                        Incrementally loading pages should display useful content within
                        the first 5kB.
                    </li>
                    <li>The main navigational links should load first to allow the use
                        of the most likely link before the page has completed loading.
                    </li>
                    <li>All links to objects over 75kB should be clearly labeled with
                        the size of the object.
                    </li>
                    <li>At least Internet Explorer 6 and 7 and Firefox 2 should be
                        supported.
                    </li>
                    <li>Static content should be used where possible. Where dynamic
                        content is used, scripts must set and check last modified dates to
                        enable caching.
                    </li>
                    <li>The HTTP Expires response header should be set by the web
                        server for every resource returned to requesting clients.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cache-control headers should not be used in such a way as to
                        entirely disable caching.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pages should not auto-refresh.</li>
                    <li>Compression must be enabled.</li>
                    <li>The W3C standards must be complied with and the compliance of
                        the final website validated.
                    </li>
                    <li>Formatting should not be embedded in the same file as the
                        content but should be performed using an external CSS file or
                        files.
                    </li>
                    <li>The site must still be usable if image viewing is turned off. A
                        text alternative must be provided to all images and they must be
                        scaled to the size they will appear in the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>All the functionality of the site must still be available with
                        JavaScript turned off.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cascade high bandwidth media. If video is present also provide
                        audio-only and text-only versions. If PDFs are present also provide
                        HTML or text-only versions. If large images are present, link to
                        them using thumbnails or low bandwidth versions.
                    </li>
                    <li>No page should require more than 10 HTTP requests.</li>
                    <li>If PDFs are present then they must be optimised for low
                        bandwidth. Vector-based graphics should be used to represent line
                        drawings such as diagrams. If PDFs are large, alternative versions
                        should be offered with different levels of image compression, or no
                        images at all. Lengthy documents should be split into separate
                        files.

                Criterion 1: 25kB Limit for Non-incrementally Loading Pages</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>This will mean that the page loads within an acceptable time (10
                seconds over a 20kbps connection).</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>To check for compliance, each page of the site should be run
                through a web page analyser such as the <a class="external" href=
                    "http://www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/index.html">Web

                Criterion 2: 75kB Limit for Incrementally Loading Pages</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>Where a page downloads incrementally users will be more prepared
                to wait longer (maximum 30 seconds) for the full page to appear,
                but it is important that useful content downloads relatively
                quickly (within 2 seconds).</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>The <a class="external" href=

                for you to see the page loading as it would over slow connections.
                Set the bandwidth to 20kbps. Check that when viewed in this mode
                useful content is downloaded within 2 seconds, and that the whole
                page downloads within 30 seconds.</p>

                    'section-Outsourcing-Criterion3MainNavigationalLinksLoadFirst'>
                Criterion 3: Main Navigational Links Load First</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>A user may not be interested in all the content on a page. If
                they want to navigate from it to another page they should be able
                to do so without having to wait for the page to load
                completely.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>If your Internet connection is so fast that it is impossible for
                you to observe the order in which items download, the <a class=

                the process down so that you can check that the page behaves as it

                Criterion 4: Links to Objects over 75kB Clearly Labeled</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>It is important that users are given an indication of how large
                objects are before they start to download them.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>This is initially a question of visual inspection. All objects
                that are linked to should have their size in brackets after the
                link, for example <tt>PDF Report (237 kB)</tt>.</p>
            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-Criterion5SupportForDifferentBrowsers'>
                Criterion 5: Support for Different Browsers</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>At least Internet Explorer 6 and 7 and Firefox 2 should be
                supported. Together, these three browsers account for over 90% of
                the market.</p>
            <p>If possible, we recommend that you also test your site against
                other browsers: Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer 5, Firefox 1.5 and
                Konqueror which all have a small share of the browser usage market,
                and additionally older browsers such as Netscape 4 and Lynx.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>You will need to download browsers that you don't already have
                so that you can test your website under them. For links to free
                downloads of a range of browsers see <a class="wikipage" href=

            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-Criterion6StaticAndDynamicContent'>
                Criterion 6: Static and Dynamic Content</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>With static content it is easy for the system to make sure that
                pages are not re-downloaded unless they have changed since they
                were last accessed. This is not so simple in the case of dynamic
                content and it is important to make sure that the system is
                provided with information about whether pages have altered.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>You will need to check that scripts send Last-Modified headers
                with each response. You should edit a page and then check if the
                date given in the header is as expected. Tools like <a class=
                                                                           "wikipage"

                Criterion 7: Set HTTP Expires Response Headers</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>Setting these headers makes pages load much more quickly.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>Check that all web pages have a line of the form 'Expires: '

                Headers</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>If done properly, caching can significantly reduce the bandwidth
                used by visitors to your site, especially regular visitors; however
                careless use of cache-control headers can disable caching. You
                should be aware that some Content Management Systems (CMS) and
                Wikis automatically generate cache-control headers.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>Any of the following headers would break caching entirely:
                <tt>Pragma: no-cache</tt>, <tt>Cache-Control: no-cache</tt>,

                Criterion 9: Pages Should not Auto-refresh</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>If you want to have pages that auto-refresh it should be an
                optional feature that users must explicitly turn on. It is very
                easy for your users to accidentally waste huge amounts of their
                bandwidth and yours by having pages reload themselves
                automatically.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>Check that neither <tt>Refresh: 0</tt> is present in the HTTP
                Header nor <tt>&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0"&gt;</tt>
                is present in the HTML page.</p>
            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-Criterion10CompressionMustBeEnabled'>
                Criterion 10: Compression Must be Enabled</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>When enabled on both the web browser and the web server,
                compression can automatically reduce the size of text downloads
                (including HTML, CSS and JavaScript) by 50-90%.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>The Firefox <a class="external" href=
                "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60">Web Developer
                Toolbar</a><a class="footnoteref" href=
                "Outsourcing.html#ref-Outsourcing-4">[4]</a> lets you see if
                compression is turned on. Once you have downloaded the toolbar,
                clicking on <i>Information &gt; View Document Size</i> will bring
                up a page of information that shows the size of the document. If
                compression has been enabled you should get two figures, showing
                the size of the page as it is and the size it would be if it hadn't
                been compressed, for example <tt>7 KB (22 KB
                    uncompressed)</tt>.</p>
            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-Criterion11StandardsCompliant'>
                Criterion 11: Standards Compliant</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium) is an international body
                working to establish web standards. Ensuring that a website passes
                their validation tests and complies with best practice will
                eliminate the problems that badly written code can lead to.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>W3C provides validators for <a class="external" href=
                "http://validator.w3.org/">HTML</a><a class="footnoteref" href=

                                                                        "http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS</a><a

            <h3 id=
                    'section-Outsourcing-Criterion12FormattingPerformedUsingExternalStyleSheet'>
                Criterion 12: Formatting Performed using External Style Sheet</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>It is important to separate content from presentation for
                maximum efficiency of coding. If the content is written in a markup
                language such as HTML, rather than embedding formatting
                instructions in the code, the presentation should be handled by CSS
                (Cascading Style Sheets). Often the most efficient approach is to
                use a single external style sheet for the entire website.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>Check for an absence of <tt>style</tt> tags in the web page and
                look for the presence of a CSS file.</p>
            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-Criterion13UsableWithoutImages'>
                Criterion 13: Usable without Images</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>Images add significantly to the overall download time of your
                pages so it is important that they are used intelligently. Some
                users will be viewing your site with images turned off and it still
                needs to be usable in this situation.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>Turn images off in your browser and make sure that the website
                is still functional. For example, in Firefox you would turn off
                image viewing by clicking through the menu <i>Edit &gt; Preferences
                    &gt; Content</i> and de-selecting the tick box 'Load images
                automatically'.</p>
            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-Criterion14UsableWithoutJavaScript'>
                Criterion 14: Usable without JavaScript</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>Inappropriate use of JavaScript can waste bandwidth and reduce
                readability. Some users will have JavaScript disabled in their
                browsers and so you will want to be sure that your site will still
                be usable without JavaScript.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>Turn off JavaScript in your browser and check that the website
                is still fully functional. In Firefox you would disable JavaScript
                by clicking on <i>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Content</i> and
                de-selecting the tick box 'Enable JavaScript'.</p>

                Criterion 15: Provide Alternatives to High Bandwidth Media</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>Large media files may be too big to work effectively over low
                bandwidths. Provide lower-bandwidth alternatives where
                possible.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>Check that audio-only and text-only versions are provided for
                all videos and text-only versions for all audio. Check that HTML or
                text-only versions are provided for all PDFs. Check that any large
                images are linked to using thumbnails or low bandwidth
                versions.</p>
            <h3 id=
                    'section-Outsourcing-Criterion16NoPageToRequireMoreThan10HTTPRequests'>
                Criterion 16: No Page to Require More Than 10 HTTP Requests</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>The download time for a new visitor to your site is largely
                based on the number of HTTP requests required to fetch all the page
                elements. Reducing the number of HTTP requests is an important way
                of improving the performance of your site.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>

                                                                            href="Outsourcing.html#ref-Outsourcing-7">[7]</a>

            <h3 id='section-Outsourcing-Criterion17PDFsToBeOptimised'>Criterion
                17: PDFs to be Optimised</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
            <p>Large PDFs, like other large media objects, can be difficult to
                download over slow connections. PDFs that are optimised for print
                rather than screen can be very large indeed. It is often the images
                and fonts that make the biggest contribution to size, but these can
                be optimised. Consider offering PDFs with reduced quality and
                splitting lengthy documents.</p>
            <p><b>Verification</b></p>
            <p>If you have access to a PDF audit tool, such as Adobe's
                <a class="external" href=
                    "http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro/">Acrobat
                    Professional</a><a class="footnoteref" href=
                    "Outsourcing.html#ref-Outsourcing-9">[9]</a>, this can be used to
                analyse the content of the PDF. Failing such software, you should
                at least check that the PDF isn't larger than you would expect.</p>
