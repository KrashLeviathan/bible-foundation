<p><font size="3">Dear Friend,</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The Lord continues to bless the Bible
ministry.</b> Month after month, Bibles and portions flow out.
The web site receives thousands of hits and &quot;tons&quot; of
information and files flow. Dozens of emails come in from around
the world. One doctor in Great Britain sent a contribution with
the statement: &quot;Let me say again that I really do share in
your desire to make God known to others. May God be with
you.&quot; The encouragement is greatly appreciated. One lady in
South Dakota wrote that she had another 50 Bibles ready to mail
overseas.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>What a blessing.</b> One lady provided the
funds to purchase a batch of Picture Bibles (comic book style)
from International Bible Society and then placed them in doctors
offices. One contact in Malawi said they take the Scripture to
&quot;homes, hospitals, prisons, schools, markets, small
churches, bus stations, railways stations, and an open air
meetings just to mention few.&quot; Bible Foundation relies
heavily on donated storage and freight services. Please pray with
us about transportation needs in Texas.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>GHANA: </b>&quot;Please, the reason why
        I am writing to you is that I am seamstress and I have
        opened my shop on 14th November 1997. All of my machines
        has been stolen and I decided to kill myself because of
        stolen of my equipment. But I read one of your pamphlet
        and immediately I finished reading, I took God as my
        personal saviour. That is why I am still living.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>ZIMBABWE: </b>&quot;Devaluation of
        Zimbabwen currency is making a price of Bibles almost
        beond the reach of people.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>MALAWI: </b>&quot;What a wonderful
        blessing it is to see many friends turned from darkness
        to light, accepting Jesus as their only saviour and lord.
        The scriptural leaflets, books, and Bibles are weapons
        and they are putting out the burning arrows shot by the
        devil.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>ROMANIA: </b>&quot;I am learning
        English. The Bible would be a good way. Because, here in
        Romania, it is not possible to buy a good one, I am
        asking you for one.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>GHANA: </b>&quot;One time I attacked
        someone and collected his gold and later destroyed him. I
        was arrested... now I am in jail for 36 years. But
        through the help of your tracts which has reached me by
        my blockmaster, now I know that there is a God which I
        have to serve and now my life is changed.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>MALAWI: </b>&quot;Thank you very much
        for the work of love sending Bibles, New Testaments and
        gospel tracts for free distribution to the needy. Indeed,
        you have helped us through the whole year 1997. We have
        been seen in many areas of life like in lunch hour
        meetings, open air meetings in villages, in schools, in
        colleges, in secondary schools. Our reports shows that
        1,107 people have accepted Jesus Christ as the result of
        your literature. Would you also be with us this
        1998?&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>UGANDA: </b>&quot;Thank you... Your
        ministry (Bible Foundation) is doing an excellent work.
        Keep on! There is great demand for Bibles here.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>ZAMBIA: </b>&quot;We send our love to
        you and to thank you most sincerely for the good work you
        are doing to mobilise God's own creation and plunder
        hell.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>TRINIDAD &amp; TOBAGO: </b>&quot;Thank
        you so much. Thoughtful, kind and caring are just a few
        words to describe you. People like you make life a
        wonderful treasure. Thank you so much for all that you've
        done, it really meant a lot. Words will never be able to
        express the depth of appreciation this brings today. ...
        There is a great need for Bibles. The shipment you sent
        to us went like hot bread from a bakery.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>GHANA: </b>&quot;With gratitude to the
        Lord, our Saviour, I express my sincere thanks and
        appreciation for the way you have been regularly sending
        the Bibles to us for the past months. These Bibles have
        been very well received. It is wonderful the impact it
        has created in the lives of our new converts and we are
        tremendously blessed. Because recently a Christian
        village that we established among the mix Islamic
        religious set was destroy by rampaging Muslims, and those
        that were able to flee has come out without even a
        leaflet of the Holy word of God. Sooner than this
        problems do your Bibles arrived though it could not meet
        the number of the people it has serve a purpose. God
        richly bless you.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>TOGO: </b>&quot;I have already share
        Bibles and some to unbelievers. Thank God that they are
        reading their Bible and believe to the word of God, and
        now they are participating to the work of God.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>MALAWI: </b>&quot;Would you kindly send
        me as many Bibles as you can. Not for the college but to
        the Christians who lost their properties with the
        flooding water which washed away their houses, herds,
        clothes, Bibles, hymns, etc.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>GHANA: </b>&quot;I'm still distributing
        the tracts and the demand for it is still growing. The
        avenues cannot remain closed in Jesus mighty name. By
        God's grace our church is increasing in souls and the
        members are increasing in the knowledge of God. The
        backslidden and the lost are finding their way back to
        Jesus. I would therefore plead with you not to stop
        sending the Bibles and tracts as you are doing. It is
        really blessing people and advancing God's kingdom.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>ETHIOPIA: </b>&quot;You see so many
        people need the English Bible and they are asking me.
        Even those who are not Christian will ask for the Bible,
        but I give priority for those born-again
        Christians.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>MALAWI: </b>&quot;This letter is to
        thank you for your Bibles and tracts, which you sent for
        us. We know your Bibles and tracts will help us as we
        evangelize and God will cause our united efforts to bring
        forth fruit. I am deeply grateful for all you have done
        to help in my spiritual growth, so I am able to serve our
        God and help others. My prayer is that the Lord will
        continue bless you so we can continue receiving the
        literature to help us win souls to our Lord.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>
