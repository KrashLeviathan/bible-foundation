<p>July 27, 1998</p>

<p><font size="3">Dear Friend,</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Mail and email</b> continue to come in and
Bibles and Bible portions continue to go out. June saw another
mail bag party in Newberg with 100 bags of Bibles going out. The
internet traffic continues to increase. More people around the
United States are getting involved.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>A strange coincident</b> occurred recently
when a lady sent an email seeking a Braille Bible for a special
need. It so happened that a brand new Braille New Testament was
donated and it satisfied the need.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The big story is the launch of the USA
Nationwide Bible Drive</b>. July 27, 1998 saw the program
materials go up on the internet and the mail server. Materials
are available at </font><a href="http://www.bf.org/bibledrive/"><font
size="2">http://www.bf.org/bibledrive</font></a><font size="3">
and the email version is available by sending a blank email to </font><a
href="mailto:bibledrive@bf.org"><font size="2">bibledrive@bf.org</font></a><font
size="3">. Publicity materials have been mailed to over 200
Chirstian publications.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>From the mail bag:</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>GHANA: &quot;I have taken pain to read the 48 scripture
        selections you sent to me in at least 30 times. I have
        really be transformed by the power of God. There have
        been so many positive changes in my life and I bet you I
        have rich testimonies to give now. In the light of this,
        I have joined an evangelical association, helping to turn
        all sinners away from sin. We are fully on the work so
        please do send me one complete Bible to help me in my
        evangelising work.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>REPUBLIC of BELARUS: &quot;I wanted to let you know that
        I have received your shipment of Bibles that you have
        sent to my ministry. This is a great blessing and I thank
        you very much for them. &#133; I will have opportunity to
        give the Bibles to public schools and universities.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>GHANA: &quot;I have read the scriptures and I ask God to
        give me wisdom as you said. ... I have seen that God has
        change my life, to become a good boy.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>NIGERIA: &quot;I thank God for the way He uses you to
        bless the nation both youth and adults through His word.
        &#133; Our ministries is quite a big ministries with 30
        branches some are Cameroon, Kenya, Algeria, Angola,
        Niger, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Togo, Egypt, Zaire,
        Malawi, Liberia, Chad, Guinea, Uganda, and Ethiopia.
        &#133; God has been visiting us here with a mighty
        revival. Muslims, Juju Priests and unbelievers repent
        enmass both young and adults. Please help us to carry on
        this work effectively as God desires. &#133; Muslims are
        hearing the word of God eagerly.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>NIGERIA: &quot;God arrested over 1,200 Muslims to His
        kingdom and five local churches were established for the
        newly converted Muslims.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>NIGERIA: &quot;We are a Prison Ministries, serving the
        need of 10,000 refugees living in camps and inmates of
        over 561 prisons around this West African region. We
        cannot keep out of prison. It is where the Lord want us
        to be. He never abandoned one lost sheep. &#133; They
        wants Bibles in every bit as desperately as a
        concentration camp victim wants nourishing food. There is
        no people in the world that is as hungry and desperate to
        have a Bible of their own as these brethren. They will
        cherish even a single page torn from a Community Bible.
        The Bible will serve as a Key to open the treasure store
        of good things. It is a book to be read and re-read, to
        be pondered frequently, applied constantly and share with
        others!. Beloved Gospel Partner, you can have a part in
        leading men and women to the Lord. Especially at this
        hour, you can join hands with us and faithful Prison
        Chaplains. The hours are especially difficult for men and
        women behind bars. Hearts are especially tender as they
        think of loved ones whom they have disappointed or fail.
        Will you help us reach behind the bars with the love of
        Jesus now?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>IVORY COAST: &quot;Your idea of aiding the lost sheep to
        come in, is actually excellent, and hope that the
        Almighty God will reward you and the staff richly for
        good work doing. Please, I need your great help to uplift
        the school in our area and hope you will assist the
        school by sending more BIBLES.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>IVORY COAST: &quot;I am a new convert and I would like to
        know the redemptive Word of God better. It is in that
        light that I, under the advice of a friend, write to you
        in order that you might help me in the good times and bad
        to study the Word of God, which has already begun. For
        that I would like a Bible.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>NIGERIA: &quot;Since the number of people demanding for
        Holy Bible are so many, we find it difficult to give out
        to be used personally. We only place it on our reading
        Chapel for everybody to go in and read, because we don't
        have enough Bible.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>GHANA: &quot;I've been receiving the Bibles you are
        sending to me, but most wonderful part of it is the Bible
        is reaching the parishers and souls are won into the
        Kingdom of God.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>NIGERIA: &quot;I do not know how to thank or how the
        whole congregation could thank God for all the Bible's
        you send to us. I think that God had chosen you to
        experience the work that you people are doing. Your
        offering to us cannot be coming from the corrupted flesh
        but they are the work of the Holy Spirit that is taking
        place in you for our joy.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>MALAWI: &quot;I am deeply grateful for all you have done
        to help in my spiritual growth, so I am able to serve our
        God and help others. I thank God for your literature to
        help us grow spiritually and that we can help win lost
        souls. May God bless you and the ministry He has given
        you. My prayer is that the Lord will continue blessing
        you so we can continue receiving the Bibles to help us
        win souls to our Lord.&quot;</li>
