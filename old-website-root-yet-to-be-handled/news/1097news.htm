Dear Friend,<br>
<br>
<strong>October Bible Drive:</strong> The sixth annual drive
received great publicity and much far reaching community support
and large loads of Bibles continue to come in. The publicity
included several newspaper articles and radio interviews. A nice
surprise was the additional publicity received by K-LOVE radio in
California and Arizona.<br>
<br>
<strong>It takes a lot of cooperation to move the loads: </strong>In
April a Newberg business man arranged for 2 pallets of Bible
portions to be shipped from Ohio to Newberg. Over the months,
after the balance was ready, the trucking ministry in
Indianapolis picked up the other 9 pallets in Ohio and took them
to Atlanta to a firm that took them to Florida. The Florida
company brought 3 of them to Portland and took the other 6 to a
freight company in northern California who had already received 3
pallets of used Bibles from a Washington based trucking firm that
had picked them up in Newberg. The northern California company
took the 9 pallets to our contact in Hollywood, California that
will distribute them except for 2 pallets of Spanish Bible
portions that were picked up there by relatives of an evangelist
in El Salvador to start them on their journey to Central America.
This was many tons of donated freight, saving thousands of
dollars.<br>
<br>
<strong>M-bag party in Newberg:</strong> Ten volunteers prepared
101 mail bags with Bibles and portions to go to 30 countries.
Appreciation goes to host Free Methodist Church.<br>
<br>
<strong>Internet at work: </strong>Folks around the country have
been requesting information on collecting Bibles and also on
mailing them overseas. Assistance was given to one query from
Japan seeking a source for Spanish Bibles by referring to the
local United Bible Society office. <br>
<br>
<strong>From the mail bag:</strong><br>
<br>
<UL>
<LI><strong>GHANA:</strong> &quot;I read 4 scriptures each night and
have now get to know God better through prayers and studying this
scriptures. What wondered me is that I don't think of anything
apart from God.&quot;<br>
<br>
<LI><strong>LIBYA:</strong> &quot;I am Muslim ... send me your
message about Christian religion.&quot;<br>
<br>
<LI><strong>GHANA: </strong>&quot;There are hundreds of prisoners
today preaching and all their powers comes from the Bible
Foundation tracts and the Bibles sent to us. There are terrible
criminals here, but today through the God of America and the God
of Bible Foundation they have reformed.&quot;<br>
<br>
<LI><strong>SRI LANKA:</strong> &quot;These Bibles were prayerfully
given out to 6 new &quot;Born Again&quot; poor believers who
could never really afford to purchase a Bible, even if it were
available in this Buddhist village, as Christian book shops are
truly prohibited, and as such the gift of these Bibles really
resulted in great thanksgiving to God.&quot;<br>
<br>
<LI><strong>ETHIOPIA:</strong> &quot;Even if you are afar from
Ethiopia you are doing an amazing service towards the Lord in
participating in the Lord's works here in our part of the world.
I do really appreciate and thank God.&quot;.<br>
<br>
<LI><strong>MALAWI:</strong> &quot;Many have been blessed with those
Bibles in areas where we distributed those Bibles free. Praise
God! He is so wonderful to listen us beg. You have been used by
God to send Word of God. ... Seventy-nine people committed their
lives to Jesus Christ as the result of reading the literature you
sent us.&quot;<br>
<br>
<LI><strong>SOUTH AFRICA: </strong>&quot;I just want to extend my
sincere gratitude of thanks for all the Bibles that you are
sending us. These Bibles have reached many that are in need of
Bibles. ... Be blessed to know that you are a part of the rich
harvest that God is giving us. Once again THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.&quot;<br>
</UL><br>
<strong>The cry for Bibles</strong> and portions is immense.
Thousands around the nation and around the world partner with
efforts and contributions to freely move God's word. The value of
every dollar donated is multiplied many fold as a result. Praise
God for what he is doing.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bible Foundation<br>
