<P>Dear Friend,

<LI><B>A man in Missouri</B> is helping us get 2268 new paperback Bibles.
<LI><B>Much promotional printing</B> has been donated.
<LI><B>Much publicity</B> for the Bible drive has been donated.
<LI><B>Much transportation</B> has been donated.
<LI><B>The current print run</B> of 12,000,000 small portions and 200,000 giant print portions brings the total since 1987 to over 158,000,000 and 1,000,000 respectively.
<LI><B>Many Newberg area folks</B> help with processing mail, shipping packages, typing, bookkeeping and office help, as well as hundreds of folks in the Northwest to assist the Bible drive.
</UL>
<P><B>From the mail bag:</B>
<UL>
<LI><B>Philippines:</B>  "We acknowledge the generous help of Bible Foundation. ... You are the answer of our prayers. ... Your ministry is a blessing to our nation."
<LI><B>Kenya:</B> "You...have enabled me to open churches and win so many souls to Christ with the Bibles you send."
<LI><B>Ukraine:</B> "We were able to distribute the Bibles you sent to needy and grateful recipients."
<LI><B>Ghana:</B> "I am a young man of 28 years and I have been in occultism for almost 14 years, until I met Jesus Christ who set me free.  My life has being ruined with demonic tortures and pains. ... I have no means to own a Bible than to request you humbly in Jesus Christ name.  I promise when I received shall put it into good uses."
<LI><B>Malawi:</B> A refugee from Mozambique wrote there are 1,975 Christians in their church and they lack Bibles.
<LI><B>Myanmar:</B> "Many thanks for your gifts of Bibles which we just received.  We are very grateful for  your concern and love toward us in the name of our Lord." 
</UL>
<P><B>Please pray for volunteers</B> to help wrap 2,000+ Bibles for mailing overseas.  Help is also needed on occasion for mailings and various projects.
<P><B>Please join us</B> if possible for an informal get-together Monday, October 16, 1995, 7-8 PM at Newberg Friends Church, 307 South College Street in Newberg, in the Barclay A room of the back building. Parking is available behind the church, off 4th Street.
