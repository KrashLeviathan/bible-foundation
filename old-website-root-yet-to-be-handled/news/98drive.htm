<p><font size="5">1998 OCTOBER BIBLE DRIVE REPORT</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bible Foundation 7th Annual October Bible Drive in the
Pacific Northwest was in joint co-operation with K-LOVE Radio,
KPDQ, KKPZ &amp; KKSL, KHPE, KPAM, Christian News Northwest,
Mission Portland, Promise Keepers, Christian Supply, Christian
Marketplace, Emmanuel Gospel Supply, and Higher Ground Christian
Resource Center, plus many others. New developments saw the
number of collection points increase to 20, from Ashland, OR to
Seattle, WA. This resulted in more than 12,000 Bibles, New
Testaments, etc. coming in for the year. This included
approximately 5,000 from the &quot;Bible mystery man.&quot; He
told the owner of one of the collecting bookstores that because
the ministry was there collecting Bibles and sending them to
needy people around the world, he took it on as his personal
ministry to scrounge as many as he could. He said he even climbed
into dumpsters to retrieve Bibles he heard had been tossed out.</p>

<p>October also saw the launch of the first annual USA nationwide
Bible drive. The advent of the Internet and email and the
establishing of nine master collection centers made this possible.
The centers, located in AZ, CA, GA, MI, OR, PA, SC, WA, and WI,
accept large quantities of used Bibles, even damaged and pieces
of old Bibles. Bibles are collected year 'round and the annual
publicity for the drive helps spread the word. Publicity goes to
about 200 Christian publications and 1200 Christian radio
stations. Many people around the United States are starting to
get involved.</p>

<p>Bibles continue to go to needy people and many lives are
transformed. English is widely used around the world and Bibles
are sent to over 30 countries. They go to evangelistic ministries,
hospitals, nursing homes, inner city churches &amp; ministries,
rescue missions, ship ministries, prisons &amp; jails, homeless
shelters, street ministries, ethnic neighborhoods, migrant camps,
individual ministries, remote villages around the world, and
refugee camps.</p>

<p>The transforming power of Scripture is seen in the story of a
man that wrote from Nigeria. He was in a gang and did a lot of
drinking and smoking, and they would beat up people in the
streets. On the really dark side, they would offer human as well
as animal sacrifices in their temple. One day some Christians
came to the village. The man wrote, &quot;I began to study the
Bible with them. After one year I came to know Jesus was the
saviour. I was the first person in my village to become a
Christian, people ridiculed me. With time my friends became a
Christian. We went from house to house, village to villages
telling people about Jesus. They were happy to hear he was the
sacrifice, they did not have to take human being, goat and
chickens to the temple. Many time the police threatened me but I
was not afraid. I know one day truth would win. Now 550 people in
my village are Christians, including our Chiefs, but only the
problem we are facing is how to get a Bible for them to enhance
them in their study.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone that helps with the collection of Bibles, including
the many volunteers that work behind the scenes, is greatly
appreciated. Special thanks to all that had a part.</p>
