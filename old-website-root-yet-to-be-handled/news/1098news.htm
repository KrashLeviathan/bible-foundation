<p>October 30, 1998</p>

<p>Dear Friend,</p>

<p><b>Radio stations and publications</b> ran publicity about the
nationwide and northwest Bible drives. Also the website and email
autoresponder continues to give out much information through <a
href="http://www.bf.org/bibledrive"><font size="2">http://www.bf.org/bibledrive</font></a><font
size="3"> and </font><a href="mailto:bibledrive@bf.org"><font
size="2">bibledrive@bf.org</font></a><font size="3">. This year
through the end of October, Bible Foundation received about 8,000
Bibles, Testaments, etc.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Of the many calls, letters and email queries</b>
we&#146;ve received this quarter, it was a pleasure to assist
with requests from Israel, Scotland and South Africa. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Cowboys and children in Oklahoma</b> receive
God&#146;s love. Folks there have a saddle shop with boot repair,
leatherwork, blacksmith, and a library. They are also involved
with a rodeo company and have Bibles and Christian literature
available at no charge in the shop and at the rodeo.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The Bible mystery man</b> started dropping
off hundreds of Bibles at a time at one of the collection
centers. The frequency of every two to three weeks made it more
mysterious. One day in conversation he told the storeowner that
because the Bible ministry was there, getting used Bibles to
needy people around the world, he took it on as a personal
ministry to collect as many Bibles as possible, scrounging them
wherever he could, even climbing into dumpsters when needed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The bread man</b> showed up September 15,
part of the crew delivering several tons of the Bread of Life.
The Bibles and portions were brought to Newberg from the Midwest
by a ministry God raised up to help with the free and low cost
transportation of Bibles.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>From the mail bag:</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>NIGERIA:</b> &quot;The Muslims
        hierarchy set fire on our Bible College and many others.
        Our staff quarters and administration buildings were
        completely burnt down instantly. We could only stand and
        cry out to God as we saw everythings devoured by the
        fiery flames which leaped high into the air. The week of
        violence left 6 dead students, 198 injured and a group of
        burned properties. &#133;In regard to our request, we are
        appealing to you and your congregations to kindly support
        and help us with several copies of Thompson Chain
        reference Bibles, Holy Bibles&#133;&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>TOGO:</b> &quot;I read one of your
        tracts entitled &quot;The King of Heaven&quot; and I
        decide to write you. I am a lay preacher of the gospel of
        our Lord Jesus Christ and tracts of this kinds and others
        are very good for evangelism. Please, I want you to send
        me tracts as plenty as you can to enable me and my team
        to continue with the gospel. I want you also to send me
        some Bibles for me and my friends.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>NIGERIA:</b> &quot;This is to inform
        you that I came across some of your tracts, going through
        them, with the Lord of God, I become overwhelm. Further,
        I will be much delighted of other Holy books like Bible
        could be sent to me.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>GHANA:</b> &quot;When you told me to
        read the 48 scriptures carefully at about 30 times. At
        that time I was lazy, greedy, and was not good in mind
        too. When read it I knew that greedy and laziness is not
        good. I change my life and now I obey and respect anyone
        who is older than me. I pray to ask God to give wisdom as
        you said. And God listen to my prayers and gave me
        wisdom. Even last term, my position was 20th but this
        term my position was 1st. I thank God very much. My good
        friend thank you for advising me with the 48
        scriptures.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>SCOTLAND:</b> &quot;I am delighted at
        being able to find and access your website.- thanks very
        much for the service you provide I am in need of some
        help and will give you some details about myself. We have
        also commenced a ministry &quot;Gospel Outreach&quot;
        where we offer FREE Bibles, cassettes, Booklets and
        correspondence courses to those who are interested.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>NIGERIA:</b> &quot;Christ deliver me
        from the kingdom of darkness and transform me to the
        kingdom of light. I and my family were Muslims and I was
        born in the northern region of Nigeria. I collaborated
        with some Muslim leaders to commit all source of
        atrocity, including the killing of ministers of God.
        &#133; However, I was not only called by God for
        repentance, but to minister His word to the lost,
        especially the Muslims in Africa, because if we don't
        reach out to them in love and share the gospel with them,
        they will be increasingly radicalized by their fanatical
        mullahs and Imams into committing heinous acts against
        Africa and the rest of the world.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>GHANA:</b> &quot;The reason why I am
        informing you this friendly letter is that since I stated
        reading the scripture that you gave to me I see that God
        has using his miracle in me. I have read it 30 time and
        give some to my friends to read. They all are happy that
        God has using his miracle in them. I have got wisdom
        since you gave me the scripture.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>AUSTRALIA:</b> &quot;We received the
        most great living word, profound and precious Holy Bible,
        and thank the Lord Jesus Christ that he answers our
        prayers that on the other side of the vast oceans and all
        around the globe dwells the children of the Saviour, our
        Lord Jesus Christ. We received all the Holy Bibles and
        tracts &#133;Thanks of God Almighty our Saviour, Lord
        Jesus Christ, your priceless gift reached my family
        circle in the best of health. This precious, most
        powerful, living word, the Holy Bible will enlighten our
        path to righteousness in serving our Lord and Saviour
        Jesus Christ.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>SOUTH INDIA:</b> &quot;We will be ever
        grateful to you for regularly sending us your tracts and
        Bibles, which we have prayerfully distributed to the
        needy ones. In future we require more tracts and Bibles
        in bulk for which I request your goodself to kindly pray
        and supply as and when Lord leads you. Also kindly send
        the Chain Reference Bibles, concordance, etc., even if it
        is old. Similar items our pastors in our area who are
        living by faith could not afford to make. To them indeed
        these items are very much useful for them to study and
        share God's word effectively. We thank and praise God for
        your loving heart. Since we are reaching out many
        unreached areas and various neighboring villages, we
        request you to kindly pray for the same. The new villages
        we are contacting are very responsive.&quot;</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b>GHANA:</b> &quot;I heard your
        information from a friend...one of our groups leader. He
        gave me an envelope with some passages as a gift, which
        Bible Readings Packet is written on the back. I shared
        them to my group members one by one. Each got two pages.
        If someone finish I collect it and ask question about it
        and give different one to the person. I want twenty (20)
        booklet of the passages which start from BY INSPIRATION
        OF GOD, to THE FAITHFUL GOD contains 48 pages and I want
        only one (1) Bible.&quot;</font></li>
