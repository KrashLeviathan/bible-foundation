<p><font size="3">Dear Friend,</font></p>
	<P STYLE="line-height: 0.35cm"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Bible
	Drives spread: </B>Many people around the country have gotten
	involved with the collection and distribution of used Bibles. One
	radio station in Illinois did a local drive in December, hoping to
	get 500 Bibles. They were astonished to receive over 3,500. What
	they didn&rsquo;t use locally, they hauled in a rented truck to the
	master collection center about 100 miles away. Individuals, groups,
	organizations, and churches collect used Bibles and purchase low
	cost new ones.</FONT></FONT></P>

	<P STYLE="line-height: 0.35cm"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Networking
	works: </B>The Bible master collection centers around North American
	make it easier for people near them to do Bible drives. Donors make
	it possible for Bible Foundation to send out thousands of Bibles and
	millions of Bible portions. Many folks are helping individually in
	many ways. A young man in Sweden is helping send Bibles into Iran. A
	lady in Canada is sending Bibles into Liberia. A lady in Georgia
	requested more Bible portions and said &ldquo;I always feel so on
	fire for the Lord&rdquo; when handing them out. A lady in Oregon is
	doing online research to find chaplains that can use the Bible
	reading packets.</FONT></FONT></P>

	Internet connection: </B>Since 1996, we have provided at no cost
	many etexts including some public domain Bible texts to Bible
	software programmers. Millions of people have access to materials
	that came through the web site. Our web site www.bf.org still
	generates much interest and also many requests for Bibles. We
	registered two other domains. www.biblefoundation.org and
	www.bibledrive.org which point to our web site. Requests come in
	from many countries, besides the USA. In recent months we have even
	been receiving requests from China and Iran. Recently, we received
	our first request from Algeria.</FONT></FONT></P>

	being done but please pray the Lord will provide for much more to be
	done.</FONT></FONT></P>

		growing in their faith. Yes we thank God for your wonderful
		ministry, which our Lord is using to do great things over here. We
		again very humbly appeal to you to please continue sending us used
		Bibles and tracts. Our small house church believers and I will
		faithfully continue to pray for you and the Bible Foundation

		&quot;Thank you for sending me the parcel and because they were put
		to good use. Our church has more than doubled. On account of this I
		am taking this opportunity as the coming of Jesus Christ is eminent
		and more people are being won for Christ, I would be glad if
		another parcel of used or old bibles are mailed to us for
		distribution to help in the great commission that Jesus has called
		us into. New believers are grouped so they can all study the bible.
		It has worked even though we have to circulate the bibles in each
		group so that each could have access to read them individually
		weekly in turns. At least some people have been won to Christ and
		presently are on fire for Christ since we received the parcel some
		two years ago.&quot;<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> </FONT></FONT>
