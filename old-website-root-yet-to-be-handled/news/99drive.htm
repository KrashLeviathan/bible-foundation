<p><font size="5">1999 OCTOBER BIBLE DRIVE REPORT</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><br>
</font></p>

<p>The Bible Foundation 8th Annual October Bible Drive was a
great success both nationally and in the Pacific Northwest.
Interest in the on going used Bible ministry continues to spread
around the country and into Canada and the annual drive generates
much publicity. Many radio stations ran publicity and the Billy
Graham Association Decision Magazine ran an article on the
ministry. The network on independent collection centers includes
AL, AZ, CA, GA, IL, KY, MI, OR, PA, VA, WA, WI, and Canada.</p>

<p>In the Pacific Northwest co-operation included <font size="3">K-LOVE
Radio, KPDQ, KPAM, KKPZ &amp; KKSL, KHPE, KWIL, KEED, </font>Christian
News Northwest, Mission Portland, Promise Keepers, Christian
Supply, Christian Marketplace, and Emmanuel Gospel Supply, plus
many others including 20 plus collection points in Oregon and
Washington. This resulted in more than 13,000 Bibles, New
Testaments, etc. coming in for the year. The majority came in
from the &quot;Bible mystery man.&quot; This retired man puts
about 32,000 miles a year on his little car. He eats very
frugally and spends his money buying Bibles at thrift stores and
scrounging them wherever he can.</p>

<p>Bibles and Bible portions continue to go throughout the United
States and to over 30 countries. They go to ministries,
hospitals, nursing homes, inner city churches, rescue missions,
ship ministries, prisons &amp; jails, homeless shelters, street
ministries, ethnic neighborhoods, migrant camps, individuals,
remote villages around the world, and refugee camps.</p>

<p>Many requests from around the world come in begging for
Bibles. Since we can not supply every request, we often send a
set of Bible portions with instructions to read them over many
times, asking the Lord to reveal himself through the words. Then
we ask the writer to write again and tell us how God has used his
word in their life. From Ghana, one young person wrote:
&quot;Now, I am going to tell you how God has used His word in my
life. God words has made me repented from my sins. God words has
made me a good person in my studies. God words has lead me into a
good life. God words has made me love my enemies as He loves me.
God words has made me to proclaim the good news to all peoples
and God words has change my life. That is what God has used his
words in my life. So I want you to provide me a Holy Bible so
that I can used the Bible to say the good news of God. Please, I
know that you will give it to me. I am waiting for you
soon.&quot;</p>

<p>A contact in India wrote: &quot;Hindu violence against
Christian believers have sacked 50 churches and burned 4 to the
ground in India where 600 people have been killed. In India and
Sri-Lanka the church if full of people who want to follow Jesus
but have no Bibles. Will you please to remember every time you
read the Bible that millions have no Bible to read in India and
Sri-Lanka. Please remember to send us more Bibles to these
spiritually hungry people...Please send us more Bibles for Jewish
people, prison ministry, Buddhist, Sinhalies majority and the
largely Hindu Tamile who are fighting for an independent state.
We also need the Bible for India and Pakistan battlefield.&quot;</p>

many volunteers that work behind the scenes, is greatly
