<p><font size="5">1997 OCTOBER BIBLE DRIVE REPORT</font></p>

<p>The Bible Foundation 6th Annual October Bible Drive in joint
co-operation with KPDQ, K-LOVE Radio, KKPZ &amp; KKSL, KHPE,
Christian News Northwest, Mission Portland, Promise Keepers,
Christian Supply, Christian Marketplace, Emmanuel Gospel Supply,
and Higher Ground Christian Resource Center was a big success.
October through December saw 3,825 Bibles NT's, etc. come in,
bringing the total for the year to 5,087, just in the northwest.
Hundreds of churches, organizations, and individuals in the
northwest got involved and interest is spreading around the
country.</p>

<p>One bookstore collection center has been receiving a
substantial amount of donated Bibles, involving many hundreds.
When discussing it with the owner, he said he thought that over
90 percent were being brought in by one man. He said since they
were accepting the Bibles for needy people around the world, this
man took it on as a personal mission to go round up as many as he
possibly could. He would go to garage sales, thrift stores, book
stores, churches, wherever he could think to look. Much he would
get free and some he would purchase. He would even climb into
dumpsters to salvage discarded Bibles.</p>

<p>Most of the Bibles have been coming from the greater Portland,
Oregon area including Vancouver, Washington. Many of the outlying
areas have also been getting involved with various folks
arranging to have the Bible brought to one of the collection
points. One thing always seems to lead to another with this
ministry. A need for a collection center in Medford lead us to
the Salvation Army there which agreed to not only accept Bibles
dropped off there but in their Ashland and Grants Pass thrift stores
also.</p>

<p>K-Love Radio this year did an interview and used it to produce
a number of spots to promote the drive. They proceeded with the
publicity and ran it also in California and Arizona. This brought
in a number of calls showing the possibility of expanding the
October Bible drive to areas where participants must provide
shipping to collection centers. Over the years collection centers
have been arranged in MI, WI, SC, GA, AZ, CA, and OR. This is
developing toward the long time dream of a nation wide Bible
drive.</p>

<p>Our friend in Saint Louis reported that over 1000 Bibles,
Testaments, etc. have been collected there in 1997. A lady in
Louisiana led her 50 member children's choir in a production
related to the need for Bibles around the world. They raised
several hundred dollars and collected many Bibles and presented
the great need to many.</p>

<p>English is becoming the dominant world language. Bibles are
sent to over 30 countries besides the United States and go to
evangelistic ministries, hospitals, nursing homes, inner city
churches &amp; ministries, rescue missions, ship ministries,
prison &amp; jail ministries, homeless shelters, street
ministries, ethnic neighborhood ministries, migrant camps, and
individual ministries.</p>
