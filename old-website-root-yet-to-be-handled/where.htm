<P>Here I am. Come to me and I will comfort you. I love you more than you can imagine. I will be a strong tower and fortress for you. I will feed you with true bread and living water. I will nurture you and heal your soul but you must trust me. There are those that kill and destroy because they will not come to me. I have conquered death and with me you can live forever. My love can bring you through terrible times. I have always been here for you and I always will be. Come unto me and I will give you rest and peace, healing and strength. My spirit will empower you to take my love to the world. Open your eyes and you will see my hand everywhere. Come unto me.
