<H1>GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD</H1>
<B>
<p>
 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
so must the Son of man be lifted up:  That whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have eternal life.  For God so loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  For God sent
not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world
through him might be saved.  He that believeth on him is not condemned:
but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  And this is
the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved
darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  For every
one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light,
lest his deeds should be reproved.  But he that doeth truth cometh
to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought
in God.
