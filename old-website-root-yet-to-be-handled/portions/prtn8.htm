<H1>THE LORD IS MY ROCK</H1>
<B>
<P>
And David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the
day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies,
and out of the hand of Saul: And he said, the Lord is my rock, and
my fortress, and my deliverer;  The God of my rock; in him will I
trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower,
and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. I will call
on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from
mine enemies.
<P>
For thou art my lamp, O Lord: and the Lord will lighten my
darkness.
<P>
As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried:
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him. For who is God, save
the Lord? and who is a rock, save our God? God is my strength and
power: and he maketh my way perfect.
<P>
The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the
God of the rock of my salvation.
<P>
Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen,
and I will sing praises unto thy name.

<P>from 2 Samuel 22
