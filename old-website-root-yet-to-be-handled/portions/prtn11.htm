<H1>THE BREATH OF THE ALMIGHTY</H1>
<B>
<P>
The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
hath given me life.
<P>
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
regard it.  Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment
is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
<P>
God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth
he, which we cannot comprehend. For he saith to the snow, Be thou
on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of
his strength. He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may
know his work. Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters
is straitened. Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth
his bright cloud: And it is turned round about by his counsels: that
they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world
in the earth. He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for
his land, or for mercy.

<P>from Job 33-37
