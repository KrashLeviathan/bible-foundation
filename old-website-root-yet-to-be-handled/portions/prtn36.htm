And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because
he was of the house and lineage of David:) To be taxed with Mary his
espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while
they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
And she brought forth her first born son, and wrapped him in swaddling
clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them
in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in
the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel
of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round
about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them,
Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which
shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city
of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.
<P>
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will toward men.

<P>from Luke 2
