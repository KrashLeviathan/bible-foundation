<H1>THE COUNSEL OF THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
 For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done
in truth.  He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full
of the goodness of the Lord.  By the word of the Lord were the heavens
made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.  He gathereth
the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth
in storehouses.  Let all the earth fear the Lord: let all the inhabitants
of the world stand in awe of him.  For he spake, and it was done;
he commanded, and it stood fast.  The Lord bringeth the counsel of
the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none
effect.  The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts
of his heart to all generations.  Blessed is the nation whose God
is the Lord; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.  The
Lord looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
<P>
 Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon
them that hope in his mercy;

<P>from  Psalm 33
