<H1>THE LORD OUR MAKER</H1>
<B>
<P>
 O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise
to the rock of our salvation.  Let us come before his presence with
thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.  For the
Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.  In his hand
are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his
also.  The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
land.  O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the
Lord our maker.  For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture,
and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,  Harden
not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation
in the wilderness: When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw
my work.
<P>
 Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with
singing. Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made
us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his
pasture.
<P>
 For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
endureth to all generations.

<P>from Psalm 95 & 100
