<p><b>God shows his great love for you in these passages from the
Bible and he shows how you can have peace with him and with
yourself. Please read these passages over many times and as you
read ask God, quietly in your heart, to reveal himself to you
through the words. Search for him and talk to him about what you
read. You will begin to see how great he is and how great his
love is and how great his power is to keep us and that he will
never forsake us. It is necessary for him to discipline us and we
need to forsake our bad ways and seek him. When we call unto him,
he will hear and deliver us out of our troubles. He is our
strength and our hope. As the Scripture soaks into your heart you
will grow in the Lord. You will see how wisdom is better than
gold. In your daily walk, learn to ask the Lord for wisdom in
everything. When you ask, quietly listen to see what he puts into
your heart. This is the way you learn wise things to do. Seeking
the Lord out of Scripture and asking him for wisdom brings
healing to the soul and strength to do the wise thing.<br>
