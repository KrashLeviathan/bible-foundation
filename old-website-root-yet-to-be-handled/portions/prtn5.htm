<H1>HEAR THE WORDS OF THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and
hear the words of the Lord your God. And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall
know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail
drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites,
and the Jebusites. Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of
all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
<P>
That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the
Lord, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the Lord your God for
ever.
<P>
And the Lord said unto Joshua, see, I have given into thine
hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.
<P>
So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,
and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down
flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight
before him, and they took the city.

<P>from Joshua 3-6
