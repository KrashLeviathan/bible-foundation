<P>
Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ,
he sent two of his disciples, And said unto him, Art thou he that
should come, or do we look for another? Jesus answered and said unto
them, go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:
The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed,
and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel
preached to them. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended
in me.
<P>
At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from
the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so,
Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered
unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father;
neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever
the Son will reveal him. Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and
learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest
unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

<P>from Matthew 11
