<H1>REST IN THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
against the workers of iniquity.  For they shall soon be cut down
like the grass, and wither as the green herb.  Trust in the Lord,
and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt
be fed.  Delight thyself also in the Lord: and he shall give thee
the desires of thine heart.  Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also
in him; and he shall bring it to pass.  And he shall bring forth thy
righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.  Rest
in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because
of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth
wicked devices to pass.  Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret
not thyself in any wise to do evil.  For evildoers shall be cut off:
but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth.
<P>
 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches
of many wicked.  For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the
Lord upholdeth the righteous.  The Lord knoweth the days of the upright:
and their inheritance shall be for ever.

<P>from  Psalm 37
