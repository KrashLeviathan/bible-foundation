<H1>MY KING, AND MY GOD</H1>
<B>
<P>
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the
scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law
doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted
by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;
his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
<P>
For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way
of the ungodly shall perish.
<P>
Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation. Hearken
unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will
I pray. My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning
will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up. For thou art
not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell
with thee.
<P>
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also
that love thy name be joyful in thee. For thou, Lord, wilt bless the
righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.

<P>from Psalm 1 & 5
