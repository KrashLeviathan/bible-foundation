<H1>THE LORD IS KNOWN</H1>
<B>
<P>
I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: and
will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.
<P>
O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
<P>
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne
for judgment.  And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
minister judgment to the people in uprightness. The Lord also will
be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. And they
that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
not forsaken them that seek thee.
<P>
The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked
is snared in the work of his own hands.
<P>
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
<P>
The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.
<P>
But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in
thy salvation. I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully
with me.

<P>from Psalm 7-14
