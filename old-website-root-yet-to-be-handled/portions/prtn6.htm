<H1>THE LORD IS A GOD OF KNOWLEDGE</H1>
<B>
<P>
And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord,
mine horn is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;
because I rejoice in thy salvation. There is none holy as the Lord:
for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our
God. Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions
are weighed.
<P>
The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to
the grave, and bringeth up. The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich:
he bringeth low, and lifteth up. He raiseth up the poor out of the
dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among
princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars
of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath set the world upon them.
He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent
in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

<P>from 1 Samuel 2
