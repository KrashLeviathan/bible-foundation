<H1>FATHER, FORGIVE THEM</H1>

<P>
And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,
and the other on the left. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them;
for they know not what they do.
<P>
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave
up the ghost.
<P>
Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared,
and certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled away
from the sepulchre. And they entered in, and found not the body of
the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: And as they were
afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them,
Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen:
remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,  Saying,
The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and
be crucified, and the third day rise again.

<P>from Luke 23 & 24
