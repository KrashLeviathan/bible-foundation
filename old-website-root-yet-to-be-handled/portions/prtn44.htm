<B>
<P>
 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar
with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly
worship, him declare I unto you.  God that made the world and all
things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth
not in temples made with hands;  Neither is worshipped with men's
hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life,
and breath, and all things;  And hath made of one blood all nations
of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined
the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; That
they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and
find him, though he be not far from every one of us:  For in him we
live, and move, and have our being;
<P>
 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth
all men every where to repent:  Because he hath appointed a day, in
the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom
he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in
that he hath raised him from the dead.

<P>from Acts 17
