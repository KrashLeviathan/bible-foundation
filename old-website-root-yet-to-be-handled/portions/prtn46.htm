<P>
 It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them
that believe.  For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after
wisdom:  But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
and unto the Greeks foolishness;  But unto them which are called,
both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
Because
the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God
is stronger than men.  For ye see your calling, brethren, how that
not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,
are called:  But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to
confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world
to confound the things which are mighty;  And base things of the world,
and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which
are not, to bring to nought things that are:  That no flesh should
glory in his presence.  But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of
God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification,
and redemption:  That, according as it is written, He that glorieth,
let him glory in the Lord.
