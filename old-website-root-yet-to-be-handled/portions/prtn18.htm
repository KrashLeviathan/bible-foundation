<H1>THE LORD IS MY LIGHT</H1>
<B>
<P>
The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the
wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh,
they stumbled and fell.
<P>
Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon
me, and answer me. When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said
unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek. Hide not thy face far from
me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave
me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. When my father
and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up. Teach me
thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses
are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. I had fainted,
unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land
of the living. Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall
strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.

<P>from Psalm 27
