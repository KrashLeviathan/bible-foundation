<H1>THE FAITHFUL GOD</H1>
<B>
<P>Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy might.  And these words, which I command thee this
day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently
unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine
house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down,
and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And
thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.</P>
<P>
Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful
God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and
keep his commandments to a thousand generations; And repayeth them
that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack
to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.</P>
<P>
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth
his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee. Therefore thou shalt
keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and
to fear him.

<P>from Deuteronomy 6-8
