<H1>THE KING OF HEAVEN</H1>
<B>
<P>
Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages,
that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. I thought
it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought
toward me. How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders!
his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation
to generation.
<P>
And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed
the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever,
whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from
generation to generation: And all the inhabitants of the earth are
reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army
of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay
his hand, or say unto him, what doest thou?
<P>
Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those
that walk in pride he is able to abase.

<P>from Daniel 4
