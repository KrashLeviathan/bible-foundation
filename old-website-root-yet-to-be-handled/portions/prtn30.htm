<H1>RETURN UNTO THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he
that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and
milk without money and without price.
<P>
 Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while
he is near:  Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy
upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.  For my thoughts
are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.  For
as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than
your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.  For as the rain cometh
down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth
the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed
to the sower, and bread to the eater:  So shall my word be that goeth
forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall
accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing
whereto I sent it.

<P>from  Isaiah 55
