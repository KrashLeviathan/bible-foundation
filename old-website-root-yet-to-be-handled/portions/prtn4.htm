<P>
And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and
came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
<P>
And she said unto the men, I know that the Lord hath given
you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all
the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. For we have heard
how the Lord dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came
out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites,
that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly
destroyed. And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did
melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
of you: for the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth
beneath.
<P>
And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
this our business. And it shall be, when the Lord hath given us the
land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. Then she let them
down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town
wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

<P>from Joshua 2
