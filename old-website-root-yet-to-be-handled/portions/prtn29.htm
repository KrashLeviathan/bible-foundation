<H1>TRUST IN THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck;
write them upon the table of thine heart:  So shalt thou find favour
and good understanding in the sight of God and man.  Trust in the
Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.  Be
not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.  It
shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.  Honour the
Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:  So
shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst
out with new wine.  My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord;
neither be weary of his correction:  For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth;
even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
<P>
 The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding
hath he established the heavens.  By his knowledge the depths are
broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
<P>
 For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot
from being taken.

<P>from  Proverbs 3
