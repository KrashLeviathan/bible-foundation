<H1>THANKS UNTO THE FATHER</H1>

<P>
... desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his
will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;  That ye might walk
worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good
work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;  Strengthened with all
might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering
with joyfulness;  Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us
meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:  Who
hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
us into the kingdom of his dear Son:  In whom we have redemption through
his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:  Who is the image of the
invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:  For by him were all
things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible
and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities,
or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:  And he is
before all things, and by him all things consist.  And he is the head
of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from
the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.

<P>from  Colossians 1
