<H1>SEEK THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
 Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name, make known his
deeds among the people.  Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk
ye of all his wondrous works.  Glory ye in his holy name: let the
heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.  Seek the Lord and his strength,
seek his face continually.  Remember his marvellous works that he
hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
<P>
 For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: he also is
to be feared above all gods.  For all the gods of the people are idols:
but the Lord made the heavens.  Glory and honour are in his presence;
strength and gladness are in his place.  Give unto the Lord, ye kindreds
of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength.
<P>
 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let
men say among the nations, the Lord reigneth.  Let the sea roar, and
the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
<P>
 O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy
endureth for ever.

<P>from  1 Chronicles 16
