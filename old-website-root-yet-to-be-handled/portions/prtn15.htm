<H1>THE GLORY OF GOD</H1>
<B>
<P>
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth
his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night
sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice
is not heard.  Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their
words to the end of the world.
<P>
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony
of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord
are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure,
enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for
ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter
also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant
warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.
<P>
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart,
be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.

<P>from Psalm 19
