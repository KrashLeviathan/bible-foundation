<H1>THE LIVING BREAD

<B>
<P>
 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
<P>
 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and
I will raise him up at the last day.
<P>
 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me
draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.  It is written
in the prophets, and they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore
that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.  Not
that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath
seen the Father.  Verily, Verily, I say unto you, He that believeth
on me hath everlasting life.  I am that bread of life.  Your fathers
did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.  This is the bread
which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not
die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will
give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

<P>from  John 6
