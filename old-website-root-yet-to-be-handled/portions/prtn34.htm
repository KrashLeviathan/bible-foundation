<H1>JESUS WENT UNTO THEM</H1>
<B>
<P>
And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there
alone. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves:
for the wind was contrary. And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus
went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw him
walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and
they cried out for fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying,
Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. And Peter answered him and
said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And
he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked
on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous,
he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save
me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him,
and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. Then they
that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth
thou are the Son of God.
