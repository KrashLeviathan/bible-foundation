<H1>THE WORK OF GOD</H1>
<B>
<P>
 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat
which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give
unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.  Then said they unto
him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?  Jesus
answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe
on him whom he hath sent.  They said therefore unto him, What sign
shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou
work?  Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written,
He gave them bread from heaven to eat.  Then Jesus said unto them,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from
heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.  For
the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life
unto the world.  Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this
bread.  And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that
cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall
never thirst.
