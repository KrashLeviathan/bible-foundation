<H1>THE WORD OF FAITH</H1>
<B>
<P>
 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
one that believeth.  For Moses describeth the righteousness which
is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by
them.  But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to
bring Christ down from above:)  Or, who shall descend into the deep?
(that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)  But what saith
it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that
is, the word of faith, which we preach;  That if thou shalt confess
with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that
God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  For with
the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession
is made unto salvation.  For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth
on him shall not be ashamed.  For there is no difference between the
Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that
call upon him.  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord
shall be saved.
