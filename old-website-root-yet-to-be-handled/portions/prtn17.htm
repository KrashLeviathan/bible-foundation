<H1>O LORD</H1>

<P>
Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. O my God, I trust
in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over
me. Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed
which transgress without cause. Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me
thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God
of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.  Remember, O Lord,
thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever
of old. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O
Lord. Good and upright is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners
in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will
he teach his way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto
such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. For thy name's sake,
O Lord, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. What man is he that
feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.
<P>
Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord; for he shall pluck my feet
out of the net.

<P>from Psalm 25
