<H1>LOVE THE LORD</H1>
<P>
<B>Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and keep his charge,
and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.
<P>
 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and
ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
<P>
 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and
in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may
be as frontlets between your eyes.  And ye shall teach them your children,
speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest
by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
<P>
 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;  A
blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which
I command you this day:  And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments
of the Lord your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command
you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.
<P>from Deuteronomy 11
