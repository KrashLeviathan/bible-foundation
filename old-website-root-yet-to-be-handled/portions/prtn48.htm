<P>
 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without
natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,
despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers
of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness,
but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
<P>
 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution.  But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,
deceiving, and being deceived.  But continue thou in the things which
thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast
learned them;  And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which
is in Christ Jesus.  All scripture is given by inspiration of God,
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness:  That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished
unto all good works.

<P>from 2 Timothy 3
