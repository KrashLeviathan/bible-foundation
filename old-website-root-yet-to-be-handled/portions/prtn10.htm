<P>
And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage,
and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the Lord God, even my God,
will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until
thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the
Lord.
<P>
Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation:
and David said, Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for
ever and ever. Thine, O Lord is the greatness, and the power, and
the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the
heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and
thou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honour come of
thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might;
and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer
so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of
thine own have we given thee.

<P>
from 1 Chronicles 28 & 29
