"A friend of mine gave me your tract.  In fact on the day that I
was reading it, I was in a bad moon, but when I was reading I reach some
place in the middle which goes like this:  'and He said unto them, <A HREF="prtn40.htm">I am the
bread of life; he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth
on me shall never thirst'.</A>  So by then I was crying bold and behold the tears
stop coming.  I have now seen that (the) Lord care for the helpless.  God
bless you all and your company."

"I received your parcel  of few Holy Bibles and quantity

the cause of the gospel.  He is now attending our evangelical local church.
Praise the Lord, His word is powerful convincing."

studying the tracts and receiving our witness many were more than eager to
receive Christ.  In one of the villages one day we met a headmaster of a
primary school.  As we are witnessing to him, he told me that he has never
seen a Bible all his life and he is about 56 years old."

on my bed, when one of my mates brought me one of your tracts which is...
<A HREF="prtn39.htm">God So Loved World</A> &
<A HREF="prtn40.htm">The Work of God.</A>  I am also fond of reading my tracts and my
Bible.  I became so excited that even as now, I use it to preach to some of
my mates...what makes me feel happy of reading this tract is about some
people who love the darkness than the light because their deeds are evil & do
not want anybody to see them.  So one day, to my surprise, one of my mates
told me he want some tract to read & I gave him your tract & he read it.
After reading it, he was sobbing & I asked him why.  He told me he will never
get back to the world again because the words has changed him. I prayed for
him & now he is a fully Christian. So I decided to write you to know if you
would send me some tracts & if possible some Bible so that I would share it
to some of my mates both in school and church."

to God to forgive me all my sins...now I am a Christian so I need Bible to

and I decided to read the tract.  And I found truth in it.  But the Bible
scriptures in it I did not have Bible which I will read the scriptures from.
