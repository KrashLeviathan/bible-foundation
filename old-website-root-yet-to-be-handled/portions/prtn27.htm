<H1>THOU, LORD, ART GOOD</H1>
<B>
<P>
 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.  Rejoice
the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.  For
thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy
unto all them that call upon thee.  Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer;
and attend to the voice of my supplications.  In the day of my trouble
I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.  Among the gods there
is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto
thy works.  All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship
before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.  For thou art great,
and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.  Teach me thy way,
O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.  I
will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify
thy name for evermore.  For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou
hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
<P>
 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

<P>from Psalm 86
