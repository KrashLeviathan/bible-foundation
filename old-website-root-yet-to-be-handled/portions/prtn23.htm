<H1>THE LORD BE MAGNIFIED</H1>
<B>
<P>
 I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and
heard my cry.  He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of
the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.  And
he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many
shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.  Blessed is that
man that maketh the Lord his trust, and respecteth not the proud,
nor such as turn aside to lies.  Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful
works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward:
they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare
and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
<P>
 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared
thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness
and thy truth from the great congregation.  Withhold not thou thy
tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth
continually preserve me.
<P>
 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
such as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.

<P>from  Psalm 40
