<H1>HAVE MERCY UPON ME, O GOD</H1>
<B>
<P>
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions.
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be
clear when thou judgest.
<P>
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness; that
the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. Hide thy face from my
sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart,
O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy
presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.  Restore unto me the
joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.  Then will
I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
<P>
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

<P>from Psalm 51
