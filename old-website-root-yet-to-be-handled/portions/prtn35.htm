<H1>THE SON OF MAN HATH POWER</H1>

<P>
 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they
let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.  When Jesus saw
their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be
forgiven thee.  But there was certain of the scribes sitting there,
and reasoning in their hearts,  Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies?
who can forgive sins but God only?  And immediately when Jesus perceived
in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto
them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?  Whether is it easier
to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to
say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?  But that ye may know that
the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the
sick of the palsy,)  I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed,
and go thy way into thine house.  And immediately he arose, took up
the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all
amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
