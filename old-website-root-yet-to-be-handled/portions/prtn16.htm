<H1>THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD

<B>
<P>
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to
lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in
the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my
cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the
days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<P>
The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world,
and they that dwell therein. For he hath founded it upon the seas,
and established it upon the floods.
<P>
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting
doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory?
the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

<P>from Psalm 23 & 24
