<H1>BE GLAD IN THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity,
and in whose spirit there is no guile.
<P>
I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. For this shall every one
that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found:
surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto
him. Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. I will
instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will
guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule,
which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit
and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
<P>
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in
the Lord, mercy shall compass him about. Be glad in the Lord, and
rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright
in heart.

<P>from Psalm 32
