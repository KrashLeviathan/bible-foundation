<H1>O MAGNIFY THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.  I
sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.  They
looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.  This
poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his
troubles.  The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear
him, and delivereth them.  O taste and see that the Lord is good:
blessed is the man that trusteth in him.  O fear the Lord, ye his
saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.  The young lions
do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not
want any good thing.  Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach
you the fear of the Lord.
<P>
 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.  Many are the afflictions
of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.

<P>from  Psalm 34
