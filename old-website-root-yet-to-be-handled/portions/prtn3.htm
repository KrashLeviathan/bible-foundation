<H1>PUBLISH THE NAME OF THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,
the words of my mouth. My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech
shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and
as the showers upon the grass:  Because I will publish the name of
the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto our God. He is the Rock, his work
is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without
iniquity, just and right is he.
<P>
O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
would consider their latter end!
<P>
See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me:
I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any
that can deliver out of my hand. For I lift up my hand to heaven,
and say, I live for ever.
<P>
Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge
the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries,
and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.

<P>from Deuteronomy 32
