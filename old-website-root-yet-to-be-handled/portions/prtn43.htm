<P>
Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth
him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. The word which
God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ:
(he is Lord of all:) That word, I say, ye know, which was published
throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which
John preached; How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost
and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were
oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. And we are witnesses
of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem;
whom they slew and hanged on a tree: Him God raised up the third day,
and shewed him openly; Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen
before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose
from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and
to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge
of quick and dead. To him give all the prophets witness, that through
his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.
