<H1>THE LORD ANSWERED JOB</H1>
<B>
<P>
Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird
up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer
thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof,
if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
<P>
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion
thereof in the earth? Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
that abundance of waters may cover thee? Canst thou send lightnings,
that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?
<P>
Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
the south?  Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest
on high?
<P>
Then Job answered the Lord, and said, I know that thou canst
do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
<P>
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine
eye seeth thee.  Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and
ashes.

<P>from Job 38-42
