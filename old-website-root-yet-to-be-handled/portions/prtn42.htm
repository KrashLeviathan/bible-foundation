<P>
Verily, Verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
everlasting life. I am that bread of life.
<P>
As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father:
so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
<P>
When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it,
he said unto them, Doth this offend you? What and if ye shall see
the Son of man ascend up where he was before? It is the spirit that
quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto
you, they are spirit, and they are life. But there are some of you
that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were
that believed not, and who should betray him. And he said, Therefore
said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given
unto him of my Father. From that time many of his disciples went back,
and walked no more with him. Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will
ye also go away? Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall
we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are
sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.
