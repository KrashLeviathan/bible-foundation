<H1>THE TRUE GOD</H1>
<B>
<P>
Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man
glory in his riches:  But let him that glorieth glory in this, that
he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise
lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in
these things I delight, saith the Lord.
<P>
But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an
everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations
shall not be able to abide his indignation.
<P>
He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
When
he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens,
and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he
maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his
treasures.
<P>
O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is
not in man that walketh to direct his steps.  O Lord, correct me,
but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.

<P>from  Jeremiah 9 & 10
