<H1>SERVE THE LORD</H1>
<B>
<P>
And Samuel said unto the people, It is the Lord that advanced
Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land
of Egypt. Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before
the Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord, which he did to you
and to your fathers.
<P>
And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all
this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the Lord, but serve
the Lord with all your heart; And turn ye not aside: for then should
ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they
are vain. For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's
sake: because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people. Moreover
as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing
to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for
consider how great things he hath done for you.

<P>from 1 Samuel 12
