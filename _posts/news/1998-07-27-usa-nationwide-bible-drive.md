# USA Nationwide Bible Drive

*27 July 1998*

Dear Friend,

Mail and email continue to come in and Bibles and Bible portions
continue to go out. June saw another mail bag party in Newberg with
100 bags of Bibles going out. The internet traffic continues to
increase. More people around the United States are getting involved. 

A strange coincident occurred recently when a lady sent an email
seeking a Braille Bible for a special need. It so happened that a
brand new Braille New Testament was donated and it satisfied the need. 

The big story is the launch of the USA Nationwide Bible Drive. July
27, 1998 saw the program materials go up on the internet and the mail
server. Materials are available at [http://www.bf.org/bibledrive] 
(http://www.bf.org/bibledrive) and the email version is available by
sending a blank email to [bibledrive@bf.org](mailto:bibledrive@bf.org). 
Publicity materials have been mailed to over 200 Chirstian 
publications. 

# From the mail bag:

> desperate to have a Bible of their own as these brethren. They will 
> cherish even a single page torn from a Community Bible. The Bible will

> and share with others!. Beloved Gospel Partner, you can have a part in 
> leading men and women to the Lord. Especially at this hour, you can

> For that I would like a Bible." 

## NIGERIA

> so many, we find it difficult to give out to be used personally. We 
> only place it on our reading Chapel for everybody to go in and read,

## GHANA

> "I've been receiving the Bibles you are sending to me, but 
> most wonderful part of it is the Bible is reaching the parishers and 
> souls are won into the Kingdom of God." 

## NIGERIA

> could thank God for all the Bible's you send to us. I think that God 
> had chosen you to experience the work that you people are doing. Your 
> offering to us cannot be coming from the corrupted flesh but they are 
> the work of the Holy Spirit that is taking place in you for our joy." 

## MALAWI

> spiritual growth, so I am able to serve our God and help others. I 
> thank God for your literature to help us grow spiritually and that we 
> can help win lost souls. May God bless you and the ministry He has 
> given you. My prayer is that the Lord will continue blessing you so we 
> can continue receiving the Bibles to help us win souls to our Lord."
