# Bible Drives, Networking, and Internet Connection

*25 March 2003*

## Bible Drives spread 

Many people around the country have gotten involved with the collection 
and distribution of used Bibles. One radio station in Illinois did a 
local drive in December, hoping to get 500 Bibles. They were astonished 
to receive over 3,500. What they didn’t use locally, they hauled in a 
rented truck to the master collection center about 100 miles away. 
Individuals, groups, organizations, and churches collect used Bibles 
and purchase low cost new ones. 

## Networking works 

The Bible master collection centers around North American make it 
easier for people near them to do Bible drives. Donors make it possible 
for Bible Foundation to send out thousands of Bibles and millions of 
Bible portions. Many folks are helping individually in many ways. A 
young man in Sweden is helping send Bibles into Iran. A lady in Canada 
is sending Bibles into Liberia. A lady in Georgia requested more Bible 
portions and said “I always feel so on fire for the Lord” when handing 
them out. A lady in Oregon is doing online research to find chaplains 
that can use the Bible reading packets. 

## The Internet connection 

Since 1996, we have provided at no cost many e-texts including some 
public domain Bible texts to Bible software programmers. Millions of 
people have access to materials that came through the web site. Our web 
site www.bf.org still generates much interest and also many requests 
for Bibles. We registered two other domains. www.biblefoundation.org 
and www.bibledrive.org which point to our web site. Requests come in 
from many countries, besides the USA. In recent months we have even 
been receiving requests from China and Iran. Recently, we received our 
first request from Algeria. 

## Small packages from Newberg, OR 

Many people provide the Bibles, money, and labor to respond to 
thousands of requests a year with small packages of used English Bibles 
and Bible portions. Much is being done but please pray the Lord will 
provide for much more to be done.

## The cry for Bibles and portions is immense. 

Thousands of people around the nation and around the world harmonize 
efforts and contributions to freely move God’s word. The value of every 
dollar donated is multiplied many fold as a result. Praise God for what 
he is doing. 

Sincerely,

Jerry Kingery
