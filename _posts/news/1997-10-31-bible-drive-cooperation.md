# Bible Drive, Cooperation

*31 October 1997*

## October Bible Drive: 

The sixth annual drive received great publicity and much far reaching 
community support and large loads of Bibles continue to come in. The 
publicity included several newspaper articles and radio interviews. A 
nice surprise was the additional publicity received by K-LOVE radio in 
California and Arizona. 

## It takes a lot of cooperation to move the loads: 

In April a Newberg business man arranged for 2 pallets of Bible 
portions to be shipped from Ohio to Newberg. Over the months, after the 
balance was ready, the trucking ministry in Indianapolis picked up the 
other 9 pallets in Ohio and took them to Atlanta to a firm that took 
them to Florida. The Florida company brought 3 of them to Portland and 
took the other 6 to a freight company in northern California who had 
already received 3 pallets of used Bibles from a Washington based 
trucking firm that had picked them up in Newberg. The northern 
California company took the 9 pallets to our contact in Hollywood, 
California that will distribute them except for 2 pallets of Spanish 
Bible portions that were picked up there by relatives of an evangelist 
in El Salvador to start them on their journey to Central America. This 
was many tons of donated freight, saving thousands of dollars. 

## M-bag party in Newberg: 

Ten volunteers prepared 101 mail bags with Bibles and portions to go to 
30 countries. Appreciation goes to host Free Methodist Church. 

## Internet at work: 

Folks around the country have been requesting information on collecting 
Bibles and also on mailing them overseas. Assistance was given to one 
query from Japan seeking a source for Spanish Bibles by referring to 
the local United Bible Society office. 


## From the mail bag:

### SRI LANKA

The cry for Bibles and portions is immense. Thousands around the nation 
and around the world partner with efforts and contributions to freely 
move God's word. The value of every dollar donated is multiplied many 
fold as a result. Praise God for what he is doing. 

Sincerely,
