# Good Year 1996, Trucker to Assist

*13 January 1997*

Dear Friend, 

**1996 was a great year:** The Lord continues to raise up folks to help 
move Scripture. Over 5700 Bibles, NT's, etc. were collected last year 
with over 3200 of them coming in after the October drive started. The 
mail volume escalated and over 20,000 letters came in from around the 
world. More and more people are finding out that they can get involved 
and assist with moving Scriptures to needy hearts. 

**Praise God!** Trucker Dan has agreed to assist with moving some very 
needed cartons from southern California to Newberg. The printer in Ohio 
has printed the 10,000,000 portions and they are now being cut, 
cartoned, and palletized. Please pray that we will be able to work out 
good transportation arrangements. 

**Rejoice with us!** The mail we receive continues to bring wonderful 
heart warming stories of how God is delivering souls and people are 
growing in the Lord and learning to commune with the Lord. Bibles have 
been moving into Europe and our Austrian connection established a 
contact in Ireland. Saint Louis, MO reported good success with the 
Bible drive with more participation.
