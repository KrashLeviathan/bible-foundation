# M-bag Parties, Successes, Gladiolas

*22 January 1998*

Dear Friend,

M-bag parties are a success. We had three in 1997 and the next is 
scheduled for the 28th of February, 9am at North Valley Friends Church 
on College Ave. at North Valley Road. We put out over 100 mail bags of 
Bibles to about 30 countries and more people keep getting involved. 

How do you put a value on it? Thousands of people, organizations, radio 
stations, publishers, etc. around the United States are getting 
involved and doing what they can. Many thousands of Bibles and millions 
of Bible portions go around the world. People receive them and the 
distribution process continues. There is great joy knowing one's 
efforts and contributions are multiplied many times. A little money 
goes a very long way. 

The internet continues to generate interesting opportunities. Our web 
site [http://www.bf.org](http://www.bf.org) receives thousands of "hits"
a month. This brings some interesting email. A man in Norway requested
information so he could mail English Bibles from Norway. A man in
Mozambique emailed and requested Bibles be sent to him via Zimbabwe. 

A great wintertime blessing was bestowed on many of the local 
volunteers. A shipper that has donated many tons of free freight 
services to us over the last 10 years had 2 crates of fresh gladiolas 
in Portland to dispose of and he let us have them. The flowers were 
shared amongst many of the volunteers and brought a beautiful and 
colorful wintertime blessing that was greatly enjoyed. 

## From the mail bag: 

### JAMAICA

> "I also hear of the wonderful and great work that you are doing 
> from a relative of mine. ... Those tract that you have sent to her, 
> they have helped me a lot and I love to read them. ... I'm telling you 
> she's been doing a great job, she's been passing out tracts and also 
> the Bibles to those who don't have any." 

### INDIA

> "Just recently a young Hindu who was a drug addict and discouraged 
> with life, was on a railway bridge, about to jump over to train. His 
> name is Mr. S. He reached into his bag for drugs to make it easier. In 
> his bag was a Bible and tract given to him earlier by us. After reading 
> the John 3:18, he visited us with questions. He talked with us about 
> two hours and was saved. Now he is a missionary to his own people in 
> Madras, South India. This was all through a Bible Foundation Bible." 

### NIGERIA

> "Through my drug connections, I easily learned the business of drug 
> distribution and eventually became a successful drug dealer in order to 
> keep up my own habit. I was further enticed into the drug scene as I 
> partied with popular rock musicians and was captivated by their 
> hedonistic existence. I was involved in smuggling large quantities of 
> cocaine from west to south Africa after sometime. I became a heavy 
> cocaine user, but now I'm change clean. Washed by the blood of Jesus. I 
> thank God for men like you who changed my life. I also thank God that 
> my lives are richer and fuller, more stable than ever before and 
> peaceful through knowing Jesus as my personal saviour." 

### MALAWI

> "Bibles are very expensive so that many churches are using tracts 
> instead of using Bibles."  

Please pray that the Lord will provide for much more Scripture to go 
out and then do what you can.  

Sincerely,

Jerry Kingery
