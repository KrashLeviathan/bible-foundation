# NW Bible Drive a Sucess

*2 January 1996*

Dear Friend, 

You are invited to an **open house** and work party Monday, January 15 
between 7 and 8 p.m. Come and go as you please. Look at the photos and 
materials that show the ministry; visit and ask questions, and help 
package some Bibles for mailing, if you feel like it. 

**Churches are asked** to send representatives and announce in their 
services and groups that there are volunteer opportunities to help send 
thousands of Bibles overseas. The Scripture ministry has many aspects, 
including courier opportunities for international travelers and 
military personnel. Folks that would like to get involved are 
encouraged to explore the possibilities. 

**The NW Bible drive** was a wonderful success with almost 6,000 
Bibles, Testaments, etc. coming in during October and November, with 
over 7,000 for the whole year. Just before the end of the year, 
$2,500.00 was donated for the purchase of another 2,000+ one dollar 
Bibles and another $1,000.00 was donated which can be used for postage. 
Rejoice with us in all that the Lord is doing.

> entrusted into your leadership. Thanks for the vision you have at least 
> to give used Bibles to those believers who have no Bibles. Keep on! We 
> are supporting you by our daily prayers. ...Therefore as I have already 
> mentioned in my first letter, we are displaced and most of us are 
> refugees here in Uganda. We have lost almost all the necessary 
> materials for our personal use and the Lord's work, due to the civil 
> war in the Sudan. There is GREAT NEED of Bibles among the displaced

> like the Word of God (Bibles)." 

## GHANA
