# October Bible Drive, New Printer

*4 October 1996*

Dear Friend, 

**The October Bible drive is under way:** Our fifth annual drive here 
in the northwest is now in progress. Many churches and individuals have 
called to express their support. Many help with the October publicity 
but remember the collection centers accept Bibles year round. 

**Praise God!** We now have a new printer for the Scripture portions 
after all these months. They are a ministry with a fairly new press 
with 3 webs and they are now printing 10,000,000 portions for us. 

**Rejoice with us!** We are getting wonderful letters telling how God 
is using his word to change lives. We have sent many Bibles and much 
Scripture to the prison where P.T. is and we've received a letter from 
a man that was saved when in prison there and is now free and living 
for the Lord as an evangelist. New areas keep opening up. A long time 
supporter introduced to us a missionary to Europe that will help get 
Scriptures into a number of areas including Austria, Bosinia, Macedonia 
Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. 

**Over 100 countries** use the English language and cries for Bibles 
pour in. A seamen's center in Senegal, a young minister in Cameroon, an 
evangelist in Zimbabwe, 'juju' priest converts in Nigeria, plus 
thousands more need English Bibles. Remember, the more help, the more 
Scripture goes out. Please pray the Lord of the harvest will raise up 
more folks to help.
