# Demand for Bibles Outstripping Supply

*8 April 1996*

Dear Friend, 

**How do you collect and mail thousands of Bibles to needy people 
around the world?** You don't, unless the Lord raises up lots of folks 
with the heart to help. Many people in Oregon and around the country 
have gotten involved but the demand for Bibles continues to escalate, 
outstripping the ability to supply. Letters begging for Bibles once 
coming in at a rate of 30 to 40 a week now come in at a rate of 300 to 
400 a week with 723 last week. 

**Trucker Dan!** A man in Newberg that donates warehouse space for the 
Bible ministry read in January about the radio station in Coos Bay, 
Oregon that wanted to do a Bible drive there and thought of his brother 
that worked for a Christian radio station in Redding, California. He 
suggested I contact him which and when I did, he told me about a 
trucker that had come into the station 4 years earlier and offered to 
transport materials for Christian groups on occasion at no cost but he 
said he was moving and only left his old phone number and the name of 
the small town he was moving to. Since we needed to have a pallet of 
Bibles brought from Hollywood, California to Newberg, Oregon, I tracked 
the man down and called his house. His wife said he worked for someone 
else now and was not in a position to do that anymore. As we talked she 
suggested I contacted a retired trucking broker in a small town in 
southern Oregon. I did and he referred me to several others. One of 
those also referred me to several others and then said "What town did 
you say you were in?" When I said "Newberg," he told me about trucker 
Dan. He said Dan drove truck to Los Angeles every week and might be 
able to haul the load. I contacted Dan and we made arrangements and 
within a few weeks, the load was in Newberg, at no cost to Bible 
Foundation. We tried for many months to find a way to get the Bibles to 
Newberg and it happened in a most fascinating roundabout way. 

**Please pray** that the Lord will provide a new printing source for 
the Scripture portions and that he will raise up more help to mail 
thousands of Bibles to begging hearts overseas. Rejoice with us in all 
that the Lord is doing. 

# From the mail bag: 

## Akwa, NIGERIA

> "In the evening of 3rd Nov 1995, about 8:30 p.m. 
> some of our students were in the classroom reading, others in the 
> chapel praying. Group of Muslim hierarchy with their army surrounded 
> our premises and set fire. Before the students could realize this, fire 
> was already surrounded them. It was only few students could escape from 
> this incident through bountiful love of God. Twenty-five lives were 
> lost, three hundred and sixty eight others wounded. We could only stand 
> and cry out to God as we saw everything devoured by the fiery flames 
> which leaped high into the air." 

## Uyo, NIGERIA

> "There is a great and serious evangelistic works 
> among Muslim in that Muslim hierarchy has organized an army of Muslim 
> with an order to bring all the converts back into the fold of 
> Mohamedism. This has resulted in severe persecution for many of the 
> converts. So severe that their lives were threaten and their Bibles 
> were burnt. Some were badly beaten and forced to leave their village 
> after all their personal possession were confiscated. The real and 
> biggest problem we face now, brethren, is to provide these our dear 
> converts and those whose Bibles were burnt and personal possessions 
> confiscated with Bibles. In many areas, up to 100 believers share one 
> Bible. In some areas, the ratio of converts to Bible is 1000 to 1. One 
> of the converts said to me last month, 'I wish I would learn God's word 
> by heart. But I do not have good memory. My greatest wish is to possess 
> Holy Bible.' Our real and greatest need brethren is to provide these 
> our dear converts and those brethren whose Bibles were burnt and 
> personal possession confiscated with Bibles. This is why brethren we 
> are now sharing this letter with you today with this enclosed one 
> hundred names of our converts and brethren whose Bibles were burnt and 
> personal possessions with no money to purchase another Bible."
