# Foreign Mail Hits 1350 a Week

*8 July 1996*

Dear Friend, 

**The mail floods in!** Most of the mail is from overseas but requests 
for the free Scripture portions and trays from stateside continue to 
come in also. The volume of foreign mail has escalated from 300 to 400 
letters a week to over 1,000 letters a week with a high week of
over 1350. The present volunteer staff was able to keep current with about 
750 letters a week; so, you can see the Lord continues to provide 
opportunities for more volunteers. The need for the Scriptures is ever 
so great. 

**Speaker available.** If you know of anyone looking for a speaker 
please let them know about Bible Foundation. I am even available for 
small group home meetings. 

**Please pray** that the Lord will provide the volunteers and means to 
distribute many more tons of Scripture around the world. 

## From the mail bag: 

### MYANMAR

> " Thank you very much for your kindness and love toward 
> us. May God bless you and all the donors more abundantly." There 

### GHANA

> "I am by this letter expressing my profound gratitude to you 
> on the Bibles sent to me." 

### ETHIOPIA

> "I thank you so much for your continuous support toward 
> the work of the Lord here in the Ethipioan." 

### GHANA

> "I am a Muslem and am writing you this letter...I want to 
> get a Bible." 

### MALAWI

> " Thank you very much for the Bibles mailed to us. They are 
> being used by preachers for the harvest of lost souls. May God richly 
> reward you for the great work you are undertaking." 

### GHANA

> A young man wrote: "My conversion brought a big conflict 
> between me and my father. The whole family were against me, branded me 
> a black goat in the family. My father told my three elder brothers to 
> poison my food if they get the chance. Also anybody who will kill me 
> will be doing a great service to Allah because I have betray the 
> Islamic religion." He then said he went to school and became a pastor 
> and started a church and most of the converts were Muslims. He said 
> "Also most of the Moslem converts are able to read and write, so I will 
> beg you to help us with your old Bibles so as to combat the bad 
> doctrines of the Islamic religion. The moslem are seriously 
> evangelizing, but Jesus is always victorious."
