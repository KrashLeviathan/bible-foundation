# Radio Stations Promoting Bible Drive; Transportation to El Salvador

*9 October 1995*

Dear Friend, 

There is cause for great rejoicing: 

- The NW Bible drive is well underway with KDBX, KPDQ, KPHP, and K-Love 
  radio stations cosponsoring the promotion. The Saint Louis, Missouri 
  Bible drive is also underway. 
- Transportation to El Salvador has been arranged for millions of 
  Scripture portions. 
- A man in Missouri is helping us get 2268 new paperback Bibles. 
- Much promotional printing has been donated. 
- Much publicity for the Bible drive has been donated. 
- Much transportation has been donated. 
- The current print run of 12,000,000 small portions and 200,000 giant 
  print portions brings the total since 1987 to over 158,000,000 and 
  1,000,000 respectively. 
- Many Newberg area folks help with processing mail, shipping packages, 
  typing, bookkeeping and office help, as well as hundreds of folks in 
  the Northwest to assist the Bible drive.
