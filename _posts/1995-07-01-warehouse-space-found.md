# Warehouse Space Found

*1 July 1995*

Dear Friend, 

The Lord continues to bless the flow of Scripture as hundreds of 
letters and calls pour in each month. The Lord continues to provide and 
volunteer opportunities abound. 

- **Minnesota:** A call came in from the ship Caribbean Mercy which is
  one of the YWAM Mercy Ships and in port in Duluth. A 100,000 Spanish
  and 40,000 English portions were requested for an upcoming trip to
  the Caribbean. 
- **Chicago:** A man called looking for Bibles for his ministry. We had 
  helped him a couple of times in 1994 and can now assist from Newberg 
  plus our contacts in Iowa and Missouri. 
- **California:** A prisoner said some of his Christian brothers had 
  written about 6 months ago and received some study Bibles and he would 
  like to get one if he could. He said he is hungry for more in depth 
  study in the word of God and thanked us for our ministry that reaches 
  out to the prisoner to help those "who want to grow in grace and 
  knowledge in our Lord Jesus Christ." 
- **Ethiopia:** One writer said he was so thirsty for the word of God 
  but could not get a Bible. Another said the 14 members of their Bible 
  study group only had one Bible and would like more with different 
  versions. 
- **India:** A young person received a Bible Foundation Scripture 
  portion and wrote that he recently read a wonderful piece from the Holy 
  Bible from Matthew 14 titled "Jesus went unto them." He said he was 
  really impressed and was very curious to know more about it.  

## Rejoice: 

Needed temporary warehouse space with access to a forklift has been 
made available!

## Looking for: 

- Folks to help move and put cartons of Bibles on skids and wrap the 
  loads. 
- A Seattle contact that could collect and store Bibles for pick up.  

## Quarterly get-together: 

- Updates. 
- New photos and letters from overseas. 
- A recorded interview with the man responsible for the nationwide 
  distribution of our giant print portions to nursing homes. 
- Optional simple work project. 
- Visiting. 
- You are invited. 
- Monday, July 17, 7-8 PM at Newberg Friends Church, 307 South College 
  Street in Newberg. Parking is available behind the church, off of 4th
  Street, and we will be meeting in the Barclay A room of the back
  building.  

Sincerely,

Jerry Kingery
