Dear Friend, 

**The seed keeps being sown:** People around the country continually 
share the word of God. The couple in Ohio that have been mailing Bibles 
overseas have now sent out over 8,300 since 1992. A group of young 
people in Pennsylvania have developed an evangelistic outreach of 
witnessing and passing out tracts. They said the fire of evangelism is 
growing and more and more young people are wanting to join them. The 
Portland camp stove ministry continues to feed the street people on 
Friday and Saturday nights and souls continue to come to the Lord and 
Bibles go out. The lady in South Dakota recently requested another 80 
mailing labels to send Bibles overseas. A seafarer wrote from United 
Arab Emirates that there were several believers on ship and he would 
like Bibles to be able to give out in their journeys. In one project, 
volunteers prepared 74 mail bags, filling a Suburban to the roof. 

**The internet ministry grows:** The Bible Foundation web site 
[http://www.bf.org](http://www.bf.org) continues to offer more materials and services. 
Various public domain Bibles and materials are available as well as 
links to numerous Scripture related sites. Information about the 
Scripture ministry is also available. 

**Discipling the nations:** Folks are encouraged to teach others (1) to 
read Scripture and ask God to reveal himself in it, and (2) to ask God 
in every situation of life for wisdom and quietly listen to what he 
puts into the heart. This teaches people how to feast on the word and 
grow in the Lord. 

**Please pray** that the Lord of the harvest will continue to raise up 
folks to help. 

# From the mail bag: 

## KENYA

> "Many people we gave the tracts came after two or three days 
> and wanted to receive Jesus as their personal saviour. Eighty people 
> got saved in the first crusade." 

## NIGERIA

> "I have read your tracts entitled 'God Is Our Refuge' and 
> 'The Lord Be Magnified'. Thank you for these tracts which have been 
> very helpful to me. I will be grateful if you send these tracts to me 
> for distribution to the unreached citizens of this world." 

## SENEGAL

> "God bless you all. Thank you again and again to you all 
> who made it possible to send me "THE HOLY BIBLES". Thank you all." 

## MALAYSIA

> "I received the Bible on 27th December 96. God loved me 
> too much. He opened my mind, eyes, heart to hear His word." 

## LIBYA

> "I was very happy when I got to know of your address from 
> one of our scripture memory books." 

## INDIA

> "I sent one large lettered English Bible to an old couple in 
> a home. They are very very happy to receive it. She wrote to me that 
> her husband was hugging the Bible to his breast. He feels this is the 
> greatest treasure to him." 

## UGANDA

> "There is great demand for used Bibles here. Many believers 
> have no Bibles in their hands, especially those in the rural areas. ... 
> Therefore we beg you to continue sending us more used Bibles." 

## An African prison officer

> "Many people have been reformed here 
> through your anointed tracts that you send here. Kindly do well to send 
> me more of your tracts alongside BIBLES. Your tracts are indeed good 
> for the inmates."
