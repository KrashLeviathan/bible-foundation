Dear Friend,

The Lord continues to bless the Bible ministry. Month after month, 
Bibles and portions flow out. The web site receives thousands of hits 
and "tons" of information and files flow. Dozens of emails come in from 
around the world. One doctor in Great Britain sent a contribution with 
the statement: "Let me say again that I really do share in your desire 
to make God known to others. May God be with you." The encouragement is 
greatly appreciated. One lady in South Dakota wrote that she had 
another 50 Bibles ready to mail overseas. 

What a blessing. One lady provided the funds to purchase a batch of 
Picture Bibles (comic book style) from International Bible Society and 
then placed them in doctors offices. One contact in Malawi said they 
take the Scripture to "homes, hospitals, prisons, schools, markets, 
small churches, bus stations, railways stations, and an open air 
meetings just to mention few." Bible Foundation relies heavily on 
donated storage and freight services. Please pray with us about 
transportation needs in Texas.
