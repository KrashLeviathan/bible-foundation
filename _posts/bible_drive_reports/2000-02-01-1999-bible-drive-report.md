# 1999 October Bible Drive Report

*February 2000*

The Bible Foundation 8th Annual October Bible Drive was a great success 
both nationally and in the Pacific Northwest. Interest in the on going 
used Bible ministry continues to spread around the country and into 
Canada and the annual drive generates much publicity. Many radio 
stations ran publicity and the Billy Graham Association Decision 
Magazine ran an article on the ministry. The network on independent 
collection centers includes AL, AZ, CA, GA, IL, KY, MI, OR, PA, VA, 
WA, WI, and Canada.

In the Pacific Northwest co-operation included K-LOVE Radio, KPDQ, 
KPAM, KKPZ & KKSL, KHPE, KWIL, KEED, Christian News Northwest, Mission 
Portland, Promise Keepers, Christian Supply, Christian Marketplace, 
and Emmanuel Gospel Supply, plus many others including 20 plus 
collection points in Oregon and Washington. This resulted in more 
than 13,000 Bibles, New Testaments, etc. coming in for the year. The 
majority came in from the "Bible mystery man." This retired man puts 
about 32,000 miles a year on his little car. He eats very frugally and 
spends his money buying Bibles at thrift stores and scrounging them 
wherever he can.

Bibles and Bible portions continue to go throughout the United States 
and to over 30 countries. They go to ministries, hospitals, nursing 
homes, inner city churches, rescue missions, ship ministries, prisons 
& jails, homeless shelters, street ministries, ethnic neighborhoods, 
migrant camps, individuals, remote villages around the world, and 
refugee camps.

Many requests from around the world come in begging for Bibles. Since 
we can not supply every request, we often send a set of Bible portions 
with instructions to read them over many times, asking the Lord to 
reveal himself through the words. Then we ask the writer to write 
again and tell us how God has used his word in their life. From Ghana, 
one young person wrote: "Now, I am going to tell you how God has used 
His word in my life. God words has made me repented from my sins. God 
words has made me a good person in my studies. God words has lead me 
into a good life. God words has made me love my enemies as He loves me. 
God words has made me to proclaim the good news to all peoples and God 
words has change my life. That is what God has used his words in my 
life. So I want you to provide me a Holy Bible so that I can used the 
Bible to say the good news of God. Please, I know that you will give it 
to me. I am waiting for you soon."

A contact in India wrote: "Hindu violence against Christian believers 
have sacked 50 churches and burned 4 to the ground in India where 600 
people have been killed. In India and Sri-Lanka the church if full of 
people who want to follow Jesus but have no Bibles. Will you please to 
remember every time you read the Bible that millions have no Bible to 
read in India and Sri-Lanka. Please remember to send us more Bibles to 
these spiritually hungry people...Please send us more Bibles for Jewish 
people, prison ministry, Buddhist, Sinhalies majority and the largely 
Hindu Tamile who are fighting for an independent state. We also need 
the Bible for India and Pakistan battlefield."

Everyone that helps with the Bible ministry, including the many 
volunteers that work behind the scenes, is greatly appreciated. Special 
thanks to all that had a part. Bible drive materials are available on
