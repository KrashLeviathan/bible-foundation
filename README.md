# Bible Foundation Website

This is a website created for Bible Foundation. It is optimized for
low-bandwidth based on guidelines found at
[Aptivate's Web Design Guidelines for Low Bandwidth page]
(http://www.aptivate.org/webguidelines/Home.html).

Other guidelines have been provided by Bible Foundation founder
Jerry Kingery, who can be reached at [bf@bf.org](mailto:bf@bf.org). I'll
add stuff to the [CONTRIBUTING.md]
(https://github.com/KrashLeviathan/bible-foundation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
doc as I'm able.

## Adding Posts to the Blog

Everything in the `posts/` directory is generated from markdown files
in the `_posts/` directory, and gets replaced when the script
`convert_markdown_to_html.sh` is run from the `_posts/` directory.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md]
(https://github.com/KrashLeviathan/bible-foundation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more information.
