# Bible Foundation Website

This is a website created for Bible Foundation. It is optimized for
low-bandwidth based on guidelines found at
[Aptivate's Web Design Guidelines page]
(http://www.aptivate.org/webguidelines/Home.html).

Other guidelines have been provided by Bible Foundation founder
Jerry Kingery, who can be reached at [bf@bf.org](mailto:bf@bf.org). I'll
add stuff to the CONTRIBUTING.md doc as I'm able.
